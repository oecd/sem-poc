      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0001" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The global recovery is becoming self-sustained and more broad based. The recovery is taking place at different speeds, between advanced and emerging economies, but also within the first group of countries. <line:annotation annotation_id="16" concept-id="124079">Unemployment</line:annotation> remains high across most of the <line:annotation annotation_id="17" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> countries. In most, headline <line:annotation annotation_id="18" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> has risen strongly, and expectations are also drifting up; however, underlying <line:annotation annotation_id="19" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> seems likely to edge up only slowly. Vibrant <line:annotation annotation_id="20" concept-id="22875">domestic <line:annotation annotation_id="21" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation></line:annotation> growth, negative <line:annotation annotation_id="22" concept-id="29789">supply</line:annotation> shocks and strong <line:annotation annotation_id="23" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> inflows in non-OECD economies are generating inflationary pressures prompting policy restraint that could slow the recovery.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Such a <line:annotation annotation_id="24" concept-id="27661">scenario</line:annotation> calls for differentiated policy responses in advanced and emerging economies. In both groups of countries structural reforms should play a key role while taking into <line:annotation annotation_id="25" concept-id="126268">account</line:annotation> country-specific needs and institutional features. In advanced economies, structural reforms can boost potential growth, thereby facilitating fiscal consolidation and easing the pace of monetary policy normalisation. In emerging economies, monetary policy should tighten more to curb <line:annotation annotation_id="26" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation>, but this option risks being constrained by inducing stronger <line:annotation annotation_id="27" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> inflows. In emerging economies, structural reforms could make growth more sustainable and inclusive, while contributing to global rebalancing and enhancing long-term <line:annotation annotation_id="28" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="29" concept-id="29436">flows</line:annotation>.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0003" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The outlook is surrounded by risks. Some of them are endogenous to the pace of expansion; others are associated with the possibility of specific events. Upside risks include unexpected short-term stimulus from additional structural measures and more buoyant private-sector <line:annotation annotation_id="30" concept-id="29213">activity</line:annotation> as confidence increases. Some of the risks are two-sided. Oil <line:annotation annotation_id="31" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="32" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="33" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> may rise or fall back over the projection period. While the earthquake and tsunami in <line:annotation annotation_id="34" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> could have additional negative consequences on <line:annotation annotation_id="35" concept-id="29213">activity</line:annotation> further reconstruction packages could hasten the rebound. Most risks are on the downside, however, including: further increases in oil and other <line:annotation annotation_id="36" concept-id="29312">commodity</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="37" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="38" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="39" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> which could feed into core <line:annotation annotation_id="40" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation>, a deeper slowdown in <line:annotation annotation_id="41" concept-id="CHN">China</line:annotation>, an unsettled fiscal situation in the <line:annotation annotation_id="42" concept-id="USA">United States</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="43" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> and renewed weakness in housing <line:annotation annotation_id="44" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation>. Financial vulnerabilities are increasing in the euro area in spite of strong <line:annotation annotation_id="45" concept-id="29216">adjustment</line:annotation> efforts in peripheral countries. A concern is that, if downside risks interact, their cumulative impact could weaken the recovery significantly, possibly triggering stagflationary developments in some advanced economies.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0004" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">All this suggests that the global crisis may not be over yet. Policy <line:annotation annotation_id="46" concept-id="25196">makers</line:annotation> must intensify efforts to deal with medium-term challenges. Four such challenges stand out: dealing with high <line:annotation annotation_id="47" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> and preventing it from becoming entrenched; sustaining growth and avoiding stagnation; making progress in fiscal consolidation; and managing global imbalances while supporting orderly saving reallocation. These challenges are interconnected and require a comprehensive and credible policy approach.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0005" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">While the recovery is bringing some improvements in labour <line:annotation annotation_id="48" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> conditions in advanced economies, total, and especially long-term, <line:annotation annotation_id="49" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> remains high in many countries. Also drawing on lessons from the crisis, labour <line:annotation annotation_id="50" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> policies have a key role to play in preventing cyclical <line:annotation annotation_id="51" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> from turning structural. Such policies could include more effective placement <line:annotation annotation_id="52" concept-id="27796">services</line:annotation> with training to match workers and jobs; rebalancing employment protection towards temporary workers; and temporary reduction in labour taxation through well <line:annotation annotation_id="53" concept-id="94549">targeted</line:annotation> marginal job <line:annotation annotation_id="54" concept-id="29806">subsidies</line:annotation> in countries where labour <line:annotation annotation_id="55" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation> is weak. The employment impact of such measures would be boosted by stronger competition in sectors such as retail trade and <line:annotation annotation_id="56" concept-id="30770">professional <line:annotation annotation_id="57" concept-id="27796">services</line:annotation></line:annotation>. Moreover, the crisis has demonstrated the utility of well designed work-sharing arrangements in minimising employment loss during downturns.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0006" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Return to work and competition-enhancing measures would also contribute to stronger potential growth, which could otherwise remain weak. Indeed, as experience shows, following financial crises there are risks of stagnation as structural <line:annotation annotation_id="58" concept-id="29216">adjustment</line:annotation> and financial repair are delayed. Stagnation could also emerge from persistent deterioration of the structural and <line:annotation annotation_id="59" concept-id="30723">business</line:annotation> environment. Even if such risks do not materialise the impact of the crisis in lowering potential <line:annotation annotation_id="60" concept-id="26237">output</line:annotation> is becoming clearer. Such permanent <line:annotation annotation_id="61" concept-id="26237">output</line:annotation> loss could, eventually, lower realised <line:annotation annotation_id="62" concept-id="24130">growth rates</line:annotation>. The potential for growth-enhancing structural reforms and policies to unleash new sources of growth is substantial. Governments should intensify their efforts in implementing them.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0007" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Lower growth would feed back negatively on fiscal consolidation, while evidence shows that, beyond some thresholds, public debt levels have a negative impact on growth. In spite of some improvement in fiscal positions, consolidation requirements to merely stabilise debt are substantial for many countries. The <line:annotation annotation_id="63" concept-id="USA">United States</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="64" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation>, for which such requirements are among the largest, have yet to produce credible medium-term plans while other countries need to bolster medium-term fiscal <line:annotation annotation_id="65" concept-id="94549">targets</line:annotation> by specifying the measures that will be implemented to achieve them. For most countries, further action would be needed to bring debt levels back to pre-crisis levels. The overall <line:annotation annotation_id="66" concept-id="27661">scenario</line:annotation> has changed with respect to the pre-crisis situation when a significant contribution to fiscal sustainability came from the fact that interest rates were well below <line:annotation annotation_id="67" concept-id="24130">growth rates</line:annotation>. This is unlikely to be the case in the years to come as interest rates will rise and growth could be slower. Structural reforms, while boosting growth, can also help fiscal consolidation by increasing <line:annotation annotation_id="68" concept-id="23077">efficiency</line:annotation> in the provision of key <line:annotation annotation_id="69" concept-id="27796">services</line:annotation> such as health and education. Finally, it would be dangerous to believe that higher <line:annotation annotation_id="70" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> could address debt sustainability. Higher and persistent <line:annotation annotation_id="71" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> could damp real growth by raising <line:annotation annotation_id="72" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="73" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="74" concept-id="29658">price</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> and exchange-rate volatility. It could also risk unhinging <line:annotation annotation_id="75" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> expectations, with the result that interest rates would soon increase more than <line:annotation annotation_id="76" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation>.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0008" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Last but not least, imbalances have been widening again as the global economy is recovering. They show, however, a somewhat different configuration as <line:annotation annotation_id="77" concept-id="CHN">China</line:annotation>’s <line:annotation annotation_id="78" concept-id="29313">current <line:annotation annotation_id="79" concept-id="126268">account</line:annotation></line:annotation> surplus is well below pre-crisis peaks due to adverse terms–of–trade movements and less buoyant export performance, and high-saving oil-producing economies see mounting surpluses. A desirable rebalancing mechanism should be growth-enhancing and sufficiently symmetric to avoid putting an excessive burden on deficit countries. Such a rebalancing would require more exchange-rate flexibility, which could also help mitigate inflationary pressures in countries where these are strong, while country-specific structural reforms could help to reduce saving and raise <line:annotation annotation_id="80" concept-id="123880">investment</line:annotation> in surplus countries, and boost saving in deficit countries. In monetary unions, competition-enhancing reforms of labour and <line:annotation annotation_id="81" concept-id="26830">product</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="82" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation> could also facilitate <line:annotation annotation_id="83" concept-id="29216">adjustments</line:annotation> in external positions.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0009" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The policy challenge is not to eliminate imbalances but to keep them sustainable, so as to facilitate international reallocation of savings in ways that are supportive of growth. This requires open and long-term-oriented <line:annotation annotation_id="84" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="85" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation>. Structural policies have an important impact on size and composition of <line:annotation annotation_id="86" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> movements. At the same time there is a need to reconcile open <line:annotation annotation_id="87" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="88" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation> with the goal of coping with short-term instability through temporary measures. It is important that, including under the auspices of the G20, advanced and emerging economies agree on a framework that would allow such goals to be reconciled.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0010" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The global economy is exiting the recession but is not returning to <line:annotation annotation_id="89" concept-id="30723">business</line:annotation> as usual. The post-crisis economy will have to deal with old and new challenges, while pursuing new, green and inclusive sources of growth. This requires rethinking the policy paradigm as we draw lessons from the crisis.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In framing the new, post-crisis policy paradigm, some of the existing principles underlying policy should be confirmed, such as those related to supply-side responses to boost growth, while recognising that such policies have additional positive <line:annotation annotation_id="90" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> on rebalancing and fiscal consolidation. The assignment of monetary policy to achieve <line:annotation annotation_id="91" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="92" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="93" concept-id="29658">price</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> stability and a rule-based <line:annotation annotation_id="94" concept-id="23593">fiscal policy</line:annotation> to achieve sustainable public finances should be confirmed, while the contribution of fiscal institutions to fiscal discipline could be further explored. But additional lessons should be drawn. The endogenous generation of instability and imbalances out of (apparent) tranquillity, a phenomenon common to several if not all crisis episodes, has been dangerously overlooked. This reinforces the need for financial-sector reform and tighter prudential policies, both at the micro and macro levels.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0012" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Finally, as a more complex world than what we believed to be the case requires a broader policy tool kit, we also need to take a closer look at how such tools interact and what can be done to enhance synergies. In this vein another lesson from the crisis is that international cooperation is important both in dealing with emergency situations and in shaping the way forward. This requires agreement on common principles, and, if necessary, common rules, while allowing for country-specific needs. As we slowly leave the crisis behind us, we should be wary of the risk of losing impetus in the search for better global economic governance.</p>

Global growth has picked up since the soft patch in the middle of last year and <line:annotation annotation_id="95" concept-id="29213">activity</line:annotation> is driven increasingly by strengthening private final <line:annotation annotation_id="96" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation>. However, progress remains uneven across economies. In the near term, the adverse supply-side shocks from high <line:annotation annotation_id="97" concept-id="29312">commodity</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="98" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="99" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="100" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> and the earthquake in <line:annotation annotation_id="101" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> and its aftermath are damping <line:annotation annotation_id="102" concept-id="29213">activity</line:annotation> somewhat and pushing up headline <line:annotation annotation_id="103" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation>. Such <line:annotation annotation_id="104" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> should fade from the latter half of this year, provided <line:annotation annotation_id="105" concept-id="29312">commodity</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="106" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="107" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="108" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> stabilise and <line:annotation annotation_id="109" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> expectations do not become unanchored. Financial conditions continue to improve and monetary policy remains accommodative in the <line:annotation annotation_id="110" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> economies, though increasingly less so in emerging <line:annotation annotation_id="111" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> economies where spare capacity has been largely absorbed. This should allow the recovery to strengthen, despite increasingly widespread fiscal consolidation. Global <line:annotation annotation_id="112" concept-id="26237">output</line:annotation> growth is expected to be close to 4¼ per cent this year and 4½ per cent in 2012 (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="BDFEDGFJ" />). On this basis, labour <line:annotation annotation_id="113" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> conditions would continue to improve slowly, though at 7% by the end of 2012, the <line:annotation annotation_id="114" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="115" concept-id="124079" /><line:annotation annotation_id="116" concept-id="124017">unemployment</line:annotation> rate would still remain well above the pre-crisis level. Underlying <line:annotation annotation_id="117" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> is expected to edge up slowly, as <line:annotation annotation_id="118" concept-id="23042">economic slack</line:annotation> diminishes, to around 1¾ per cent by end-2012. Outside the <line:annotation annotation_id="119" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> area, <line:annotation annotation_id="120" concept-id="22875">domestic <line:annotation annotation_id="121" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation></line:annotation> is expected to remain robust, necessitating further policy measures to damp inflationary pressures.</p>

Several monthly trade and global indicators, notably export orders, point to trade growth gaining further momentum, but these are being offset, at least in the second quarter, by the disruption to global <line:annotation annotation_id="222" concept-id="28380"><line:annotation annotation_id="223" concept-id="29789">supply</line:annotation> chains</line:annotation> and Japanese export capacity in the aftermath of the earthquake in <line:annotation annotation_id="224" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs01" />).

According to a recent survey by the <line:annotation annotation_id="321" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> External Trade Organisation (JETRO, 2010), Japanese affiliates in Asia and Pacific regions rely relatively heavily on procurement from <line:annotation annotation_id="322" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation>.

At least one-half, and in many cases 80% to 100%, of procurement is sourced locally for around two-thirds of Japanese affiliates (JETRO, 2008). Hence the <line:annotation annotation_id="330" concept-id="26843">production</line:annotation> disruption and its related consequences from events in <line:annotation annotation_id="331" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> would be more severe for Japanese affiliates in neighbouring countries in Asia.</p>

Where policy changes have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. Where government plans are available for 2012, fiscal projections follow the plans. Otherwise, in countries with impaired public finances, a tightening of the underlying primary balance of 1% of <line:annotation annotation_id="907" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2012 has been built into the projections. Where there is insufficient information to determine the allocation of budget cuts, the presumption is that they apply equally to the spending and revenue side, and are spread proportionally across components. These conventions allow for needed consolidation in countries where plans have not been announced at a sufficiently detailed level to be incorporated in the projections. Along this line, the following assumptions were adopted (with additional <line:annotation annotation_id="908" concept-id="29216">adjustments</line:annotation> if <line:annotation annotation_id="909" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> and government projections for <line:annotation annotation_id="910" concept-id="22999"><line:annotation annotation_id="911" concept-id="124299">economic <line:annotation annotation_id="912" concept-id="29213">activity</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> differ):</p>

With labour force participation rates expected to increase somewhat in most economies, after having held up better in the recent past than in earlier downturns, in part due to structural reforms such as the closing down of early <line:annotation annotation_id="1402" concept-id="29738">retirement</line:annotation> pathways out of the labour <line:annotation annotation_id="1403" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation>, the OECD-wide <line:annotation annotation_id="1404" concept-id="124079" /><line:annotation annotation_id="1405" concept-id="124017">unemployment</line:annotation> rate is projected to decline to around 7% by the end of 2012 (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-g018" />).

The increasing tightness

Much of the additional revenue accrued is likely to be saved, as appropriate for countries in which oil reserves are being depleted gradually.

Given the backdrop of impaired public finances, reforms should be consistent with the need to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of <line:annotation annotation_id="1750" concept-id="27029">public sector</line:annotation> debt dynamics. In so doing, they could result in lower long-term interest rates than would otherwise be the case.

In some cases, reserves have been built to cover future implicit liabilities related to pensions and thus should not be liquidated. Also, from a debt management perspective it may be prudent to hold assets as a cushion. In addition, it may take time before long-term loans are paid back. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the scope of asset sales, although in several countries the governments’ equity participations in banks are likely to be unwound over time. As a stylised illustration, the table below shows gross debt reductions, for countries with debt exceeding 75% of <line:annotation annotation_id="1863" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2009 or being fiscally stressed, that would prevail if all securities, or all shares, were sold (<line:annotation annotation_id="1864" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> is not included due to missing data). For most countries, such sales would not be enough to reduce gross debt to pre-crisis (2007) levels. The situation is even worse when assessed on the basis of 2010 data, with gross debt in many of these countries estimated to have increased by more than assets.</p>

Based on this legislation, the underlying <line:annotation annotation_id="1973" concept-id="29459">general government</line:annotation> deficit is projected to remain roughly unchanged. However, there is no consensus on fiscal consolidation strategies, which casts doubt on the extent to which the President’s budget proposal for next year will be adopted.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-08-n06"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-08-p0210" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The US Congressional Budget Office estimated in March 2011 that the President’s budget proposal would reduce the federal deficit from 9.9% of <line:annotation annotation_id="1974" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2011 to 7% in 2012 (CBO, 2011).

Hence, a larger degree of fiscal tightening than assumed here would be appropriate, taking into consideration that the economy has yet to fully recover from its cyclical trough. A well articulated medium-term consolidation strategy aimed at putting <line:annotation annotation_id="1977" concept-id="29459">general government</line:annotation> finances on a sustainable path also needs to be agreed as a matter of urgency and with sufficiently wide support to give it credibility.

outlays as well as revenue increases. In view of the rapid rise of public debt and the need to make plans credible, any plan should contain up-front measures.</p>

Towards this end, the <line:annotation annotation_id="1983" concept-id="23670">FMS</line:annotation> calls for keeping <line:annotation annotation_id="1984" concept-id="21680"><line:annotation annotation_id="1985" concept-id="124292">central government</line:annotation></line:annotation> primary spending (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>excluding debt repayments and interest) in FY 2011-13 below the initial budget for FY 2010, and limiting bond issuance in FY 2011-12 to that in FY 2010. The initial reconstruction package announced by the government in April 2011 is worth 4 trillion yen (0.8% of <line:annotation annotation_id="1986" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation>). Subsequent packages are expected later in FY 2011. If introduced, these could provide a near-term boost to the economy. The measures in the initial reconstruction package are to be financed without additional borrowing, in line with the authorities’ intentions of maintaining an unchanged level of bond issuance in FY 2011, largely by using budgetary reserves. Such a strategy is necessary in view of the serious fiscal situation, with gross debt at 200% of <line:annotation annotation_id="1987" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2010. While <line:annotation annotation_id="1988" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation>’s reliance on domestic financial investors, which hold some 95% of government debt, reduces the risk of a run-up in the risk premia on sovereign debt, weakening sovereign bond ratings point to increasing <line:annotation annotation_id="1989" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> concerns about the sustainability of the fiscal position. Even without additional borrowing to fund reconstruction <line:annotation annotation_id="1990" concept-id="23339">expenditure</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="1991" concept-id="29459">general government</line:annotation> gross debt is projected to reach 219% of <line:annotation annotation_id="1992" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2012. A more detailed medium-term consolidation plan, identifying the revenue and spending components to be employed to attain the stated <line:annotation annotation_id="1993" concept-id="94549">targets</line:annotation>, therefore needs to be elaborated urgently to put <line:annotation annotation_id="1994" concept-id="29459">general government</line:annotation> finances on a sustainable path. The medium-term consolidation plans should aim at a primary budget surplus that is large enough to stabilise the debt ratio rather
than just a primary budget balance. As stated in <line:annotation annotation_id="1995" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> (2011b), the consumption tax should be the main source of additional revenue, given that it is low and its impact on <line:annotation annotation_id="1996" concept-id="22999"><line:annotation annotation_id="1997" concept-id="124299">economic <line:annotation annotation_id="1998" concept-id="29213">activity</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> is less negative than other taxes. Tax measures should be accompanied by <line:annotation annotation_id="1999" concept-id="27995">social security</line:annotation> reform that limits spending increases, including in health care, and addresses problems in pensions.</p>

For example, on current plans, outlays for welfare, health care and pensions are most frequently scheduled to be cut (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-19-g024" />). This may prompt an increase in <line:annotation annotation_id="2088" concept-id="27029">public sector</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="2089" concept-id="23077">efficiency</line:annotation> and, as discussed above, encourage higher employment levels if designed in a careful way. Cuts in infrastructure <line:annotation annotation_id="2090" concept-id="123880">investment</line:annotation> are also given high priority in consolidation plans, probably reflecting the fact that they are relatively easy to implement. However, there is a risk that the short-term financial gains from cutting infrastructure spending will come at the expense of reducing future potential growth. Growth-friendly cuts in agriculture <line:annotation annotation_id="2091" concept-id="23339">expenditures</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="2092" concept-id="29806">subsidies</line:annotation> to state-owned <line:annotation annotation_id="2093" concept-id="23156">enterprises</line:annotation> and energy <line:annotation annotation_id="2094" concept-id="29806">subsidies</line:annotation> are among the least prioritised saving areas for <line:annotation annotation_id="2095" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> countries, despite sizable support for agriculture, and high levels of <line:annotation annotation_id="2096" concept-id="29806">subsidies</line:annotation> more generally, in many countries.

While the US Federal Reserve has remained in an easing <line:annotation annotation_id="2103" concept-id="22468">cycle</line:annotation>, with the current quantitative easing programme to be completed in June, the European Central Bank has now implemented an initial increase in policy rates, and central banks in many countries, including <line:annotation annotation_id="2104" concept-id="AUS">Australia</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="2105" concept-id="CAN">Canada</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="2106" concept-id="CHL">Chile</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="2107" concept-id="ISR">Israel</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="2108" concept-id="KOR">Korea</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="2109" concept-id="NOR">Norway</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="2110" concept-id="SWE">Sweden</line:annotation>, are well into their tightening <line:annotation annotation_id="2111" concept-id="22468">cycle</line:annotation>. This is also the case in many emerging <line:annotation annotation_id="2112" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> economies, which exited from the recession much earlier and in which past growth has eliminated most spare capacity and is now generating inflationary pressures. The range of policy measures adopted to manage monetary conditions also remains broad, with many emerging countries using both conventional and unconventional monetary policies, including non-market-based measures, such as reserve requirements and <line:annotation annotation_id="2113" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> controls.</p>

Upside risks to <line:annotation annotation_id="2141" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> expectations cannot now be excluded, but may be diminished by an early move that makes it easier for rates to be raised subsequently if such risks were to materialise. Equally, if an adverse shock were to occur, it would be preferable to be able to react by reducing policy rates, with fairly certain <line:annotation annotation_id="2142" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation>, rather than by renewed quantitative easing. An early move to still-accommodative interest rates would also continue to support <line:annotation annotation_id="2143" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation> whilst helping to guard against excessive risk-taking arising from close-to-zero policy rates, and the attendant risks of <line:annotation annotation_id="2144" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> misallocation or a build-up of financial fragilities. Thereafter, the challenge for the monetary authorities will be to judge the pace at which to raise policy rates so as to maintain support for the recovery whilst keeping projected <line:annotation annotation_id="2145" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> close to implicit or explicit <line:annotation annotation_id="2146" concept-id="94549">target</line:annotation> levels. The existing <line:annotation annotation_id="2147" concept-id="29803">stock</line:annotation> of assets acquired by central banks via quantitative easing programmes should be maintained until policy interest rates are well above current levels. Otherwise, asset sales would be likely to push up longer-term yields to an uncertain extent, creating considerable communication challenges and possibly also the need for offsetting policy rate responses if long-term interest rates were to jump excessively.</p>

Estimates in Slovik and Cournède (2011) suggest that in the three main <line:annotation annotation_id="2265" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> economies, banks may raise their <line:annotation annotation_id="2266" concept-id="94549">target</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="2267" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> ratios by at least 3.7 percentage points, reducing the annual rate of <line:annotation annotation_id="2268" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> growth by 0.05 to 0.15 percentage point (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDIFBIE" />). The introduction of countercyclical buffers during the credit <line:annotation annotation_id="2269" concept-id="22468">cycle</line:annotation> could further strengthen the long-term resilience of the banking sector (Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, 2010). However, it is as yet undecided at the global level, if and how, required <line:annotation annotation_id="2270" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> ratios will be increased for systemically important <line:annotation annotation_id="2271" concept-id="23545">financial institutions</line:annotation> to reflect their greater risk-taking on the back of explicit government guarantees (Blundell-Wignall<emphasis emph="italic"> et al., </emphasis>2010). Some countries have already introduced or are considering specific <line:annotation annotation_id="2272" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> requirements for systemically important banks (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis><line:annotation annotation_id="2273" concept-id="CHE">Switzerland</line:annotation> and the United Kingdom<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-33-n12"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-33-p0248" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See the Independent Commission on Banking (2011).</p></fnote>), not only to address the <shortcitation> too-big-to-fail</shortcitation> problem, but also in recognition of the fact that, especially in small countries such as <line:annotation annotation_id="2274" concept-id="CHE">Switzerland</line:annotation> that host very large <line:annotation annotation_id="2275" concept-id="23545">financial institutions</line:annotation>, some may be too big to save.

In practice, however, even under Basel III and additional national <line:annotation annotation_id="2278" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> regimes, the equity cushion is unlikely to be large enough to secure continued liquidity at all times.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-34-n13"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-34-p0251" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Until banks started benefitting from gradually expanding government backing from the middle of the 19<specchar position="sup" font="default">th</specchar> century, they typically maintained <line:annotation annotation_id="2279" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> positions above or close to 50% to convince <line:annotation annotation_id="2280" concept-id="22666">depositors</line:annotation> and lenders that their <line:annotation annotation_id="2281" concept-id="123880">investments</line:annotation> were safe.</p></fnote> Against this background, the Basel III framework will include liquidity requirements aimed at improving individual banks’ resilience to liquidity shocks. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio will require banks to hold the minimum level of high-quality liquid assets necessary to withstand an adverse liquidity stress <line:annotation annotation_id="2282" concept-id="27661">scenario</line:annotation> lasting for one month. The <line:annotation annotation_id="2283" concept-id="25732">Net</line:annotation> Stable Funding Ratio is a structural measure that requires banks to rely on stable medium to long-term funding instead of short-term money <line:annotation annotation_id="2284" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> financing. Although these requirements reduce the vulnerability of banks to liquidity risk, some concerns remain about their implementation. The liquidity requirements in their current form put a lot of emphasis on government bonds although recent developments have underscored that the safety and liquidity of government bonds cannot be taken for granted. The liquidity and stable funding requirements may also create incentives for regulatory arbitrage between different asset classes, as was the case with risk-weighted <line:annotation annotation_id="2285" concept-id="27280">regulation</line:annotation> in the run-up to the current financial crisis. Moreover, since the banking sector will require large amounts of medium to long-term funding, there is a risk
that asset-liability maturity mismatches may emerge and create vulnerabilities elsewhere in the financial system. These caveats suggest that liquidity <line:annotation annotation_id="2286" concept-id="27280">regulation</line:annotation> should: avoid assuming that domestic government bonds are necessarily always fully liquid, especially for members of a currency union; rely on simple rules rather than overly complicated weighting schemes that could open new avenues for regulatory arbitrage; and be accompanied by adequate supervision of other parts of the financial system, including insurance companies, where potentially destabilising asset-liability mismatches could migrate to.</p>

The efforts to move most trading in derivatives to public exchanges or at least central clearing houses should be completed rapidly. Effective cross-border resolution regimes also need to be put in place for large global banks to reduce the moral hazard created by a situation where they cannot be closed without destabilising repercussions. Further international convergence in accounting rules, especially for <line:annotation annotation_id="2287" concept-id="23545">financial institutions</line:annotation>, remains important to facilitate the implementation of global regulatory standards, particularly leverage caps. Furthermore, as mentioned above in the case of liquidity but also more generally, <line:annotation annotation_id="2288" concept-id="27280">regulation</line:annotation> and supervision must effectively cover areas, such as insurance and pensions, where vulnerabilities and systemic risk could migrate as a result of tighter banking <line:annotation annotation_id="2289" concept-id="27280">regulation</line:annotation>.</p>

Due <line:annotation annotation_id="2290" concept-id="126268">account</line:annotation> also needs to be taken of the extent to which macro-prudential policies affect monetary policy transmission, especially through the credit channel, and the extent to which monetary policy affects risk-taking and the build-up of leverage.</p>

And, if macro-prudential policies are impaired for any reason, or not yet fully in place, monetary policy may need to place greater weight on financial stability issues than would otherwise be merited.

The <line:annotation annotation_id="2453" concept-id="29459">general government</line:annotation> deficit is assumed to fall from 10½ per cent of <line:annotation annotation_id="2454" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2010 to 9 per cent in 2012. This is a much more moderate pace of fiscal consolidation than currently suggested by government plans, but has been assumed given the lack of political consensus on how to cut the deficit. Further progress to unwind fiscal imbalances beyond 2012 would require ambitious reforms of the tax system and entitlement spending, along the lines recommended by the President’s Fiscal Commission in late 2010.</p>

Structural deficits must be brought down so that the debt burden can be stabilised and then reduced to more prudent levels. Fiscal consolidation is now underway in all countries, with consolidation particularly marked in countries with stabilisation programmes. Prolonged consolidation and tight public finances will be required for many years in numerous countries to meet the 60% ceiling set out in the <line:annotation annotation_id="2640" concept-id="28099">Stability and Growth Pact</line:annotation>. More credible and detailed multi-year plans need to be put in place. The commitment to consolidation would be enhanced by reforms to the <line:annotation annotation_id="2641" concept-id="28099">Stability and Growth Pact</line:annotation> and to national fiscal institutions, including by implementing and going beyond proposed reforms to the Pact. The agreed quantitative standard for debt reduction may help, but its <line:annotation annotation_id="2642" concept-id="23075">effectiveness</line:annotation> risks being undermined by the inclusion of other factors.The creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has the potential to add to stability both in the near and longer term, although its credibility requires that banking system exposure to governments is well managed.</p>

The projection assumes that consolidation is implemented as planned, and that the total government deficit will fall from 5.5% of <line:annotation annotation_id="3188" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2010 to 3.5% in 2012. However, achieving these plans will require significant <line:annotation annotation_id="3189" concept-id="23339">expenditure</line:annotation> restraint compared to the previous decade, which will entail curbing public-sector compensation and defence spending. At the provincial level, priorities should include achieving operational <line:annotation annotation_id="3190" concept-id="23077">efficiencies</line:annotation> in health care and providing details on other planned measures based on strategic reviews, which are underway.</p>

The 2011 budget stipulates fiscal tightening of about ½ per cent of <line:annotation annotation_id="3404" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation>, reflecting a number of small measures. For 2012, these projections build in the Stability Programme’s planned 1% fiscal consolidation, with an even split between revenue raising measures and spending cuts. Against the background of stronger economic growth, this should secure a budget deficit of about 3½ per cent of <line:annotation annotation_id="3405" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2011 and below 3% the following year. If, as planned, similar consolidation efforts are implemented in the following years, then the medium-term objective of achieving a small budget surplus in 2015 is within reach. Such an achievement would be an important step towards securing fiscal sustainability, but will require a concerted effort by all governments in the federation. Moreover, further consolidation will be needed beyond that to ensure a reduction of the high debt-to-GDP ratio.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1062565" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The March 2011 bank stress tests were perceived as credible by financial <line:annotation annotation_id="4053" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation> as evidenced by a fall in the spread of Irish over German sovereign bond yields. It is important for the return to growth that the recapitalisation and associated restructuring of the banking system occurs without delay. In line with government and EU-IMF programme partner projections, it is assumed that the government will provide, EUR 19 billion (13% of <line:annotation annotation_id="4054" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation>) of the EUR 24 billion in <line:annotation annotation_id="4055" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> needs identified by the stress tests and that the government will receive equivalent assets in return (thus leaving the headline fiscal deficit unchanged). It is possible that some of this <line:annotation annotation_id="4056" concept-id="124381">transaction</line:annotation> will eventually be classified by Eurostat as a <line:annotation annotation_id="4057" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="4058" concept-id="28709">transfer</line:annotation>. If so, these amounts would be added to the headline deficit, but they would have no implications for the consolidation plan to 2015. Either way, combined with the ongoing borrowing needs of the government, this would result in gross public debt measured on a Maastricht basis increasing from 96% of <line:annotation annotation_id="4059" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2010 to 119% of <line:annotation annotation_id="4060" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2012. It is assumed that the government will finance the full fiscal deficit and repayment of maturing debt in 2011 and 2012 using funds disbursed under the EU/IMF programme. These funds are sufficient to cover financing needs in both years. On this basis, <line:annotation annotation_id="4061" concept-id="25732">net</line:annotation> government interest payments are projected to increase from 2.4% of <line:annotation annotation_id="4062" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2010 to 3.9% of <line:annotation annotation_id="4063" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in 2012.</p>

Since January the policy rate has been hiked by 100 basis points to 3%. This marks a welcome acceleration in policy normalisation. At the same time, efforts to restrain shekel appreciation continue. The Bank of <line:annotation annotation_id="4106" concept-id="ISR">Israel</line:annotation> still makes discretionary purchases of foreign currency, and in January it imposed a 10% reserve requirement on banks’ foreign-exchange derivative contracts with non-residents.

The plan to reduce public employment by 1% a year through 2013 should be strictly implemented, notwithstanding slippage in 2010. However, a number of factors may jeopardise the fiscal consolidation. The 2010 pension reform will be voted on in a referendum set for 5 June 2011 amid a politically challenging environment. If it is rejected, long-term fiscal sustainability will be undermined and the macroeconomic outlook could deteriorate considerably, given current volatility in international financial <line:annotation annotation_id="4898" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation>. The recapitalisation of systemic banks is already underway and will contribute significantly to the 2011 budget deficit. Further <line:annotation annotation_id="4899" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> injections could exert additional pressure on public finances. While banks have to adapt to new regulatory requirements, credit <line:annotation annotation_id="4900" concept-id="29436">flows</line:annotation> to the <line:annotation annotation_id="4901" concept-id="30723" /><line:annotation annotation_id="4902" concept-id="21432">business</line:annotation> sector have been reduced.

          <p id="ID-42-1066997" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Since December 2010, a new monetary policy has been implemented, combining low policy interest rates (to stem <line:annotation annotation_id="5187" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> inflows) with sizeable increases in banks’ required reserves (to slow credit growth). So far, this policy mix has helped to restrain currency appreciation. Credit growth has slowed in certain areas, but exhibits considerable inertia overall. In April 2011, total credit outstanding was still 35% above its level a year ago. Policymakers assert that the <line:annotation annotation_id="5188" concept-id="94549">targeted</line:annotation> credit containment will be secured, if necessary with additional regulatory measures. It is indeed essential that <line:annotation annotation_id="5189" concept-id="22875">domestic <line:annotation annotation_id="5190" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation></line:annotation> starts to slow down already from the second quarter of 2011. <line:annotation annotation_id="5191" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> projections are predicated on the achievement of this goal. Credit conditions are then expected to normalise in 2012, and policy interest rates are projected to rise.</p>

          <p id="ID-C03-42-1055980" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Against this background the Central Bank has taken both conventional and unconventional measures. It tightened reserve and <line:annotation annotation_id="5291" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> requirements in December, increased the tax on consumer credit and lifted its policy rate by a total of 125 basis points, to 12%, since the beginning of the year. Acknowledging that the costs of bringing <line:annotation annotation_id="5292" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> down to 4.5% in 2011 may be too high, the Central Bank has shifted its focus and aims to guarantee <line:annotation annotation_id="5293" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> convergence to the <line:annotation annotation_id="5294" concept-id="94549">target</line:annotation> by 2012. It has also signalled it would adopt a gradualist approach and rely heavily on macro-prudential measures. In the current environment, this strategy is not without danger. Core <line:annotation annotation_id="5295" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> might rise further, and entrenched expectations of higher <line:annotation annotation_id="5296" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> would be detrimental to the Bank’s long-term credibility and make subsequent disinflation more costly. While macro-prudential measures may help to restrain credit growth, they should be considered only as a complement to conventional monetary tightening.</p>

The authorities have announced a BRL 50 billion spending cut in the 2011 federal budget, corresponding to about 0.5 percentage point of <line:annotation annotation_id="5302" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> compared with 2010 (after correcting from the capitalisation of the state-owned oil <line:annotation annotation_id="5303" concept-id="23156">enterprise</line:annotation> <emphasis emph="italic">Petrobras </emphasis>which artificially boosted spending in September 2010). To achieve this goal, the government plans to <line:annotation annotation_id="5304" concept-id="94549">target</line:annotation> discretionary spending while safeguarding social and infrastructure programmes. Early signs are promising, as public revenues expanded at a much faster pace than spending in the first quarter of the year. Following some moderation this year, the minimum wage is set to rise by 13% in 2012, with ripple <line:annotation annotation_id="5305" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> on the growth of <line:annotation annotation_id="5306" concept-id="27997"><line:annotation annotation_id="5307" concept-id="27995">social security</line:annotation> benefits</line:annotation>, which are linked to it. Nevertheless, the primary balance <line:annotation annotation_id="5308" concept-id="94549">target</line:annotation> is expected to be reached both in 2011 and 2012, but only with the use of contingency measures, such as the exclusion of some infrastructure spending. The announced spending cuts are a welcome first step toward fiscal consolidation. However, the government needs to persevere with efforts in this direction, to ease both inflationary pressures and <line:annotation annotation_id="5309" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> inflows. The credibility of the fiscal consolidation would be enhanced by committing to a multi-year budgetary programme, which would reassure <line:annotation annotation_id="5310" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation> that measures will not be reversed in the coming years.</p>

          <p id="ID-C03-42-1056426" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Monetary policy has been tightened gradually since October 2010. Official interest rates have been raised, in steps, by a cumulative 114 basis points for three-month deposits. The required reserve ratio has been lifted by 3½ percentage points in total, reaching 21% in May for large banks. Tighter liquidity has pushed the interbank rate well above regulated saving deposit rates. In addition, the central bank introduced lending quotas for each bank.

To reduce underspending, especially on infrastructure <line:annotation annotation_id="5622" concept-id="123880">investment</line:annotation> and health insurance coverage, disbursement procedures should be simplified even further.

          <p id="ID-C03-42-1057871" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The government’s existing three-year budget plans imply no deficit reduction in the current fiscal year and only a gradual improvement thereafter. The underlying assumptions regarding revenues are probably too cautious, and the outcome may therefore be somewhat better than budgeted. Nonetheless, given the favourable external environment and a cyclical recovery that is picking up steam, a more ambitious profile of fiscal consolidation should be implemented. This would not only safeguard fiscal sustainability but also contribute to raising national savings, reducing upward pressure on the <line:annotation annotation_id="5845" concept-id="123856">exchange rate</line:annotation> and crowding in private <line:annotation annotation_id="5846" concept-id="123880">investment</line:annotation>. Restraint in <line:annotation annotation_id="5847" concept-id="27029">public sector</line:annotation> wage increases would be one measure that would both contribute to fiscal consolidation and help establish a norm of wage moderation which would encourage <line:annotation annotation_id="5848" concept-id="26787">private sector</line:annotation> employment growth. This would complement other government measures to boost employment, which rightly remain a very high priority.</p>

Based on a technical exercise, this chapter considers macroeconomic prospects for <line:annotation annotation_id="5891" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> economies to the middle of the next decade and the challenges and the associated risks. The projections described in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapters" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01" /> <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chaptersand" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01" /> suggest that nearly all <line:annotation annotation_id="5892" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> economies are expected to improve their fiscal balances over the course of this year and next. However, for many this will still leave fiscal balances too weak to stabilise government debt and for others, where debt is stable, it will be at levels which remain too high. Moreover, this chapter also discusses whether the crisis could have a long-lasting adverse <line:annotation annotation_id="5893" concept-id="121821">effect</line:annotation> on the <line:annotation annotation_id="5894" concept-id="24130">growth rate</line:annotation> of <line:annotation annotation_id="5895" concept-id="26237">output</line:annotation>, particularly as a consequence of large fiscal imbalances or continuing financial fragilities, and so lead to a prolonged period of stagnation. An alternative risk of <shortcitation>stagflation</shortcitation> – stagnation combined with <line:annotation annotation_id="5896" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> – might arise as a consequence of continuing upward pressure on oil and other <line:annotation annotation_id="5897" concept-id="29312">commodity</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="5898" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="5899" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="5900" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation>. These risks are examined in the context of previous historical episodes of stagnation and the implications for policy are considered.</p>

In the <line:annotation annotation_id="5916" concept-id="USA">United States</line:annotation>, there are a number of fiscal plans, but political disagreement makes the extent, pace and instruments of future consolidation very uncertain. For most other countries where consolidation needs are most severe, official medium-term consolidation plans more than match the requirements to stabilise debt, so that the achievement of such plans would put the debt ratio on a downward path. Nevertheless, in some of these cases the credibility of such plans needs to be enhanced by clearly specifying which spending and revenue instruments will be adjusted.</p>

Previous episodes of stagnation have led to an acceleration in debt <line:annotation annotation_id="5928" concept-id="126270"><line:annotation annotation_id="5929" concept-id="29210">accumulation</line:annotation></line:annotation>, but there is also a risk that deteriorating debt positions may adversely affect trend growth. This underlines the importance of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt levels below thresholds where there might be risks to trend growth as well as to create fiscal space for dealing with future shocks.</p>

In this respect, countries face a difficult choice between front-loaded fast consolidation and more gradual consolidation. Fast consolidation has the advantage that it may reduce the overall scale of required consolidation and reassure financial <line:annotation annotation_id="5933" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation>, but it also increases the risk of adversely affecting the recovery particularly if monetary policy is constrained. To improve the terms of this trade-off, countries should put greater weight on measures which will improve long-term fiscal sustainability – for example raising <line:annotation annotation_id="5934" concept-id="29738">retirement</line:annotation> ages or containing future increases in health costs – but which have relatively limited immediate negative <line:annotation annotation_id="5935" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> on <line:annotation annotation_id="5936" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation>. To reassure financial <line:annotation annotation_id="5937" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation>, it is also important to have a clear medium-term fiscal plan specifying objectives and the instruments that will be used. Consolidation should also avoid measures, such as reducing public <line:annotation annotation_id="5938" concept-id="123880">investment</line:annotation> or support for <line:annotation annotation_id="5939" concept-id="27398">R&amp;D</line:annotation>, which weaken the <line:annotation annotation_id="5940" concept-id="29789">supply</line:annotation> side and instead <line:annotation annotation_id="5941" concept-id="94549">target</line:annotation> measures which strengthen it.</p>

Moreover, as discussed below, an important factor tending to further increase consolidation requirements is that the differential between interest rates and growth rises over the projection. On the other hand, the <line:annotation annotation_id="6134" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> on fiscal balances from <line:annotation annotation_id="6135" concept-id="123974">population</line:annotation> ageing and continued upward pressures on health costs are not explicitly included in the projection, but these will also add to consolidation pressures (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs02" />).</p>

Although the problem of bad loans was already obvious by 1992-93 when the non-bank housing loan companies (<emphasis emph="italic">jusen</emphasis>) became insolvent, the authorities chose to adopt a wait-and-see approach because of the large scale of under-capitalisation and insolvency problems in the banking sector.

Results from a relatively small literature suggest a negative impact on growth once government debt passes a certain threshold, typically around 75% or 90% of <line:annotation annotation_id="6445" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation>. In Reinhart and Rogoff (2010), the median real per capita <line:annotation annotation_id="6446" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="6447" concept-id="24130">growth rate</line:annotation> in advanced economies falls by one percentage point when gross public debt reaches 90% of <line:annotation annotation_id="6448" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> and average growth falls even more. In Kumar and Woo (2010), each 10 percentage point increase in the gross debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with a slowdown in annual real per-capita <line:annotation annotation_id="6449" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> growth of about 0.15-0.2 percentage points per year for advanced economies, the <line:annotation annotation_id="6450" concept-id="121821">effect</line:annotation> being larger when debt goes above 90% of <line:annotation annotation_id="6451" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation>. Applying these results in a ready reckoner fashion to compute the <line:annotation annotation_id="6452" concept-id="121821">effect</line:annotation> of the recent and projected build-up of government debt can lead to rather alarming conclusions: if applied to the <line:annotation annotation_id="6453" concept-id="89546">baseline</line:annotation> projections described above for the <line:annotation annotation_id="6454" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> area as whole, the estimates imply a loss in the trend <line:annotation annotation_id="6455" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="6456" concept-id="24130">growth rate</line:annotation> of ½-¾ percentage point. Moreover, many <line:annotation annotation_id="6457" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> countries would appear vulnerable with the gross debt-to-GDP ratio in more than half of all <line:annotation annotation_id="6458" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> countries projected to rise above 75% and in nearly one-third of <line:annotation annotation_id="6459" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> countries above 90%. The transmission mechanism by which this occurs is likely to involve higher interest rates and a crowding out of private <line:annotation annotation_id="6460" concept-id="123880">investment</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="6461" concept-id="27398">R&amp;D</line:annotation>, with adverse consequences for trend <line:annotation annotation_id="6462" concept-id="26895"><line:annotation annotation_id="6463" concept-id="124064">productivity</line:annotation></line:annotation> growth.</p>

If the recovery proceeds at the projected pace, the constraints on monetary policy should be less of a concern from 2012 onwards for most countries and the pace of normalisation of interest rates could be then adjusted to partially offset any economic weakness resulting from budget improvements. The contractionary <line:annotation annotation_id="6479" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> of fiscal consolidation could also be partially offset to the extent that credible programmes reduce the risk of sovereign debt defaults, reducing risk premia on government securities which in turn reduce interest rates more generally.

On the other hand, policy changes, especially in public pension provision, and economic necessity may push up the old-age participation rate and increase the average <line:annotation annotation_id="6564" concept-id="29738">retirement</line:annotation> age, offsetting some of the projected impact, which effectively assumes that the maximum age of the working <line:annotation annotation_id="6565" concept-id="123974">population</line:annotation> is fixed at 65.</p>

In the case of <line:annotation annotation_id="6567" concept-id="ITA">Italy</line:annotation> it can be argued that this was the underlying cause of stagnation as manifest in the trend deterioration in competitiveness. In the case of <line:annotation annotation_id="6568" concept-id="PRT">Portugal</line:annotation>, it may have made it more difficult for the economy to recover from the consequences of a severe shock (in this case the ending of a credit boom). A combination of structural and fiscal reforms thus constitutes the best strategy to reduce the risks that the weak growth observed in many <line:annotation annotation_id="6569" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> countries in the post-crisis period will turn into stagnation.</p>

While there were virtually no changes in provisions to extend administratively bargaining outcomes to non-covered parties, some countries have implemented reforms aimed at changing workers’ representation mechanisms and allow firms to opt out of collective agreements in certain cases. As a result of this and, especially, of an increasingly competitive global and domestic environment, some movement towards decentralisation of wage bargaining has taken place in many countries. Indeed, the period of wage moderation observed in <line:annotation annotation_id="6779" concept-id="DEU">Germany</line:annotation> during the 2000s is to some extent an illustration of the greater flexibility firms have had in adjusting collective wage agreements so as to better reflect local conditions.</p>

Since inflows into <line:annotation annotation_id="6936" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> have also been falling in parallel, the trend decline in outflow rates had not led to an increase in the aggregate <line:annotation annotation_id="6937" concept-id="124079" /><line:annotation annotation_id="6938" concept-id="124017">unemployment</line:annotation> rate. Nevertheless, the fact that the US outflow rate had already been fluctuating around a clear downward trend over the past three decades suggests that an eventual return to pre-crisis levels may be hampered by structural forces working in the opposite direction.</p>

The rise in the share of long-term <line:annotation annotation_id="6944" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> among women need not be worrying insofar as it results from a stronger participation to the labour force and that it has coincided with a trend decline in their overall <line:annotation annotation_id="6945" concept-id="124079" /><line:annotation annotation_id="6946" concept-id="124017">unemployment</line:annotation> rate (Abraham and Shimmer, 2002).

In this regard, a key concern is that as time goes by and <line:annotation annotation_id="7006" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spells lengthen, duration dependence – that the probability of leaving <line:annotation annotation_id="7007" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> declines as an <line:annotation annotation_id="7008" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spell becomes longer – may take hold.

For instance, one study using aggregate <line:annotation annotation_id="7009" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> duration data found evidence of duration dependence in <line:annotation annotation_id="7010" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation>, English-speaking and Nordic countries, but not in Continental European countries (Elsby <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2008).<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-n07"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-p0064" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">One limitation of the methodology and data used in Elsby <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2008) is that no control is made for the influence of the composition of the <line:annotation annotation_id="7011" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> pool on observed duration dependence. Individuals with different characteristics such as age, gender or education level will generally enter an <line:annotation annotation_id="7012" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spell with different probabilities of exit which is independent from the spell duration. Therefore, it is possible that findings of duration dependence <line:annotation annotation_id="7013" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> reflect a growing share of workers with intrinsically low exit rates in the <line:annotation annotation_id="7014" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> pool as average duration increases, rather than a gradual decline over time in the probability of exit faced by individuals due to skill erosion or other hysteresis <line:annotation annotation_id="7015" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation>. </p></fnote> Empirical studies based on micro data have also found mixed evidence of pure duration dependence or hysteresis effects.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-n08"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-p0065" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See in particular Bover <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2002) and Garcia-Perez <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2010) in the case of <line:annotation annotation_id="7016" concept-id="ESP">Spain</line:annotation>.

The risk of hysteresis has become a major concern, not least because of the social consequences for the individuals directly affected. Both hysteresis and its corollary – a high <line:annotation annotation_id="7025" concept-id="121997">incidence of long-term <line:annotation annotation_id="7026" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation></line:annotation> – have plagued several continental European countries, going as far back as the 1980s. They have also become a concern in the <line:annotation annotation_id="7027" concept-id="USA">United States</line:annotation> since the recent crisis, following the unusually strong increase in the <line:annotation annotation_id="7028" concept-id="121997">incidence of long-term <line:annotation annotation_id="7029" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation></line:annotation> (Aaronson <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010).</p>

According to one, once workers become unemployed, they struggle to get back into employment regardless of the time they have spent in <line:annotation annotation_id="7030" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation>. In such a case, for a given job-seeker, the exit probability may have fallen at all <line:annotation annotation_id="7031" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> durations, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>even for short-term unemployed. This could reflect an insufficient <line:annotation annotation_id="7032" concept-id="29216">adjustment</line:annotation> of the going wage rate. Another explanation focuses instead on the gradual erosion of skills associated with <line:annotation annotation_id="7033" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spells. The longer a worker remains unemployed, the less attractive he/she appears to employers. As he/she loses attractiveness, the motivation for intensive job search diminishes and the worker becomes more detached from the labour <line:annotation annotation_id="7034" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation>. Under this explanation, there is a clear negative relationship between the probability of moving from <line:annotation annotation_id="7035" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> to employment on the one hand, and the duration of an <line:annotation annotation_id="7036" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spell on the other, a pattern referred to as <line:annotation annotation_id="7037" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> duration dependence.</p>

Observations on individual <line:annotation annotation_id="7038" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spells are exploited to assess the influence of <line:annotation annotation_id="7039" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> duration on the probability of moving from <line:annotation annotation_id="7040" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> into a job. The dataset used is composed of 17 national panels of individuals whose monthly status on the labour <line:annotation annotation_id="7041" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> has been observed over the period 2005-07. These data show that in countries where the <line:annotation annotation_id="7042" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> outflow rate is relatively high on average, it also tends to exhibit a steeper decline as durations increase. This is the case in general for English-speaking countries, Nordic countries and the <line:annotation annotation_id="7043" concept-id="NLD">Netherlands</line:annotation>. In other words, the exit probability is much higher for short-term than long-term unemployed in these countries. Conversely, in countries where the average outflow rate is relatively low (a majority of continental European countries) it is also more stable across <line:annotation annotation_id="7044" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> durations.</p>

However, when applying a statistical method to control for composition <line:annotation annotation_id="7047" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation>, using observations on individual characteristics, pure duration dependence <line:annotation annotation_id="7048" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> are found to <line:annotation annotation_id="7049" concept-id="126268">account</line:annotation> for about one-third of the decline in the rate of exit from <line:annotation annotation_id="7050" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> to employment as <line:annotation annotation_id="7051" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> duration increases. This represents an average and the proportion is higher in <line:annotation annotation_id="7052" concept-id="DEU">Germany</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="7053" concept-id="SWE">Sweden</line:annotation>, the <line:annotation annotation_id="7054" concept-id="GBR">United Kingdom</line:annotation> and the <line:annotation annotation_id="7055" concept-id="USA">United States</line:annotation> than elsewhere.</p>

The influence of two types of policies has been examined more closely, namely the duration of <line:annotation annotation_id="7057" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> benefits and spending on active labour <line:annotation annotation_id="7058" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> policies (ALMPs). As regards the former, several empirical studies have found a link between benefit duration and the average length of the <line:annotation annotation_id="7059" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spell (for a recent survey, see Krueger and Mueller, 2010). For example, recent estimates have suggested that the combined federal-state extension of benefit in the <line:annotation annotation_id="7060" concept-id="USA">United States</line:annotation> from 26 weeks to 99 weeks (or 90 weeks on a national average) in response to the crisis could, if maintained, raise the average length of the <line:annotation annotation_id="7061" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spell by between 1½ to 3 weeks corresponding to about ½ to 1 percentage point on the <line:annotation annotation_id="7062" concept-id="124079" /><line:annotation annotation_id="7063" concept-id="124017">unemployment</line:annotation> rate (Aaronson <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010). In addition, the <line:annotation annotation_id="7064" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> exit rate has been found to increase sharply at the time benefits are exhausted (Katz and Meyer, 1990). The empirical analysis conducted for this study partly corroborates this evidence. Longer benefit duration appears to reinforce duration dependence <line:annotation annotation_id="7065" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> on average across the countries in the sample.</p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-18-p0086" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">As regards spending on ALMPs, there is fairly robust evidence that it improves the probability of finding a job across all <line:annotation annotation_id="7066" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> durations, but that the <line:annotation annotation_id="7067" concept-id="121821">effect</line:annotation> might be stronger for the short-term unemployed than for those who have been unemployed for a longer period.</p>

And, in contrast to recession episodes of the 1980s and 1990s, governments have not encouraged premature withdrawal of older workers in the vain hope of reducing youth <line:annotation annotation_id="7106" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> according to a <shortcitation>lump of labour</shortcitation> view of the <line:annotation annotation_id="7107" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation>.

Several combinations of policies can achieve both aims, as illustrated in <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="OCDEid1010415" />. However, not all policy options may be equally desirable once other factors or policy objectives are considered. For instance, timing is clearly important in the current context, which would favour policies that can exert a more rapid influence on <line:annotation annotation_id="7144" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> outflows. Furthermore, policies that can reduce <line:annotation annotation_id="7145" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> persistence may to varying degrees conflict with other objectives such as budgetary consolidation, labour force participation or social protection (in particular ensuring that unemployed workers currently facing bleak jobs prospect do not fall into poverty or lose attachment to the labour <line:annotation annotation_id="7146" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation>).

But there is also a case for involving workers early in <line:annotation annotation_id="7225" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation> spells if the nature of the economic shock renders job-specific skills obsolete immediately after job loss, for instance because structural <line:annotation annotation_id="7226" concept-id="29216">adjustment</line:annotation> away from a particular sector or <line:annotation annotation_id="7227" concept-id="29213">activity</line:annotation> is needed.

In this regard, the sharp contrast in the performance of older workers and youth may to some extent reflect the large difference in several countries in the degree of employment protection between the two groups. Also, pre-crisis reforms in pension systems, as well as the closing of early routes to <line:annotation annotation_id="7309" concept-id="29738">retirement</line:annotation>, have most likely contributed to the strong labour <line:annotation annotation_id="7310" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> participation of older workers during the recent episode.

Although an empirical assessment of their long-term <line:annotation annotation_id="7331" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> is not yet possible, STW schemes have helped preserve permanent jobs during the economic downturn while promoting reductions in average hours among permanent workers.

In practice, firms may either pay some fraction of the wage cost of hours not worked, or pay the full wage during an initial period. Of these two options, the former has an advantage in that it creates better incentives at the margin to withdraw from the scheme. In contrast, when firms pay up-front the full wage for a given period, they have less incentives to withdraw once the period is over.

The most recent data (although sometimes only available to the third quarter of 2010) suggest that gross <line:annotation annotation_id="7483" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> inflows seem to be back to, or above, their pre-crisis levels in several countries, including Argentina, <line:annotation annotation_id="7484" concept-id="BRA">Brazil</line:annotation>, Colombia, <line:annotation annotation_id="7485" concept-id="IDN">Indonesia</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="7486" concept-id="MEX">Mexico</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="7487" concept-id="ZAF">South Africa</line:annotation>, where they already represent around 5% of <line:annotation annotation_id="7488" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation>, and <line:annotation annotation_id="7489" concept-id="CHL">Chile</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="7490" concept-id="TUR">Turkey</line:annotation>, where they have reached close to 8-9% of <line:annotation annotation_id="7491" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation>.

Letting the <line:annotation annotation_id="7497" concept-id="123856">exchange rate</line:annotation> appreciate and tightening <line:annotation annotation_id="7498" concept-id="23593">fiscal policy</line:annotation> could help moderate <line:annotation annotation_id="7499" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation> and related <line:annotation annotation_id="7500" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> pressures generated by the inflows, while making the inflows less attractive. Still these general principles have to be adapted to each specific country situation which in practice may mean the room for manoeuvre is limited: <line:annotation annotation_id="7501" concept-id="123856">exchange rates</line:annotation> may already be overvalued; or the fiscal stance may already be tight. The appropriate stance of monetary policy is a more complex issue as higher domestic interest may attract more inflows while a looser stance may fuel <line:annotation annotation_id="7502" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> pressures and asset <line:annotation annotation_id="7503" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="7504" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="7505" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> bubbles.

Regardless of the scope for using macroeconomic policies, there is likely to be a role for macro and micro-prudential policies, to generally limit excessive risk-taking, but also with the capacity to <line:annotation annotation_id="7514" concept-id="94549">target</line:annotation> particular sectors or asset classes, depending on the precise nature of the inflows and the associated risks.</p>

By the end of 2010 the foreign exchange reserves of <line:annotation annotation_id="7737" concept-id="CHN">China</line:annotation> alone totalled almost $3 trillion or around half of its annual <line:annotation annotation_id="7738" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="7739" concept-id="126268">accounted</line:annotation> for almost one-third of total global foreign exchange reserves.

Firstly, the build-up of reserves is closely associated with global imbalances and indeed, some have argued, contributed to the financial fragility that precipitated the recent global financial crisis. Secondly, the high opportunity cost of holding large <line:annotation annotation_id="7742" concept-id="29803">stocks</line:annotation> of low yielding assets is wasteful from a <line:annotation annotation_id="7743" concept-id="29768"><line:annotation annotation_id="7744" concept-id="28011">social welfare</line:annotation></line:annotation> standpoint (Rodrik, 2006; Summers, 2006). And thirdly, with the US dollar being the pre-eminent global reserve currency, large holders are constrained in the choices they have regarding divestment, diversification and even the productive use of these assets, as such action could entail significant negative <line:annotation annotation_id="7745" concept-id="28951">valuation</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="7746" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> (the so-called <shortcitation>dollar trap</shortcitation>).</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0037" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The reasons countries accumulate foreign exchange reserves fall into two broad categories. Firstly, reserves may be amassed as a direct consequence of export-led growth strategies and holding down the real <line:annotation annotation_id="7747" concept-id="28955">value</line:annotation> of the local currency. Reserves may also accumulate as a result of attempts to smooth short-term exchange-rate fluctuations. A second reason to hold foreign reserves is that they may provide a form of self-insurance against balance of payments crises, including sudden stops in access to external funding, or even just a means to smooth high-frequency volatility of <line:annotation annotation_id="7748" concept-id="29436">flows</line:annotation>. Traditionally, the focus was on adequately covering imports. In the late 1990s, following the Asian crisis, the focus shifted to covering a country’s <line:annotation annotation_id="7749" concept-id="29803">stock</line:annotation> of short-term debt (the so-called Guidotti-Greenspan rule). Then after the Argentine crisis, the scope of self-insurance broadened to include protecting local financial systems that are exposed to foreign <line:annotation annotation_id="7750" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> sentiment, <line:annotation annotation_id="7751" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> flight by domestic agents and <line:annotation annotation_id="7752" concept-id="123856">exchange rate</line:annotation> movements. This evolution has implied a considerable escalation in the global <line:annotation annotation_id="7753" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation> for reserves.</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0038" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">There is a considerable literature that tries to explain the levels of foreign exchange reserves held across countries and their changes over time. However, this research is hampered by a number of factors including heterogeneity in reasons for accumulating reserves (for example, the intergenerational considerations of oil and other exporters of finite <line:annotation annotation_id="7754" concept-id="27442">resources</line:annotation>) and also the increasingly large role played by sovereign wealth funds (SWF). This literature falls into two broad categories. The first approach is to use calibrated behavioural models that rely on quantifying risk aversion, discount rates and other fundamental parameters (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Jeanne, 2007 and Jeanne and Rancière, 2008). These models generally conclude that current reserve holdings are well above optimal levels in the large accumulating countries. The second approach is to determine what factors <line:annotation annotation_id="7755" concept-id="126268">account</line:annotation> for reserve <line:annotation annotation_id="7756" concept-id="126270"><line:annotation annotation_id="7757" concept-id="29210">accumulation</line:annotation></line:annotation> behaviour for a set of countries over time and then to make inferences about the behaviour of individual countries based on this (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Aizenman and Lee, 2007; Obstfeld <emphasis emph="italic">et al., </emphasis>2008; Cheung and Ito, 2009). This approach generally concludes that reserve levels in the large accumulating countries are in line with average behaviour given the particular characteristics of, and conditions in, these countries. However, the existing work that takes this second approach is somewhat outdated, and in light of the fact that reserve <line:annotation annotation_id="7758" concept-id="126270"><line:annotation annotation_id="7759" concept-id="29210">accumulation</line:annotation></line:annotation> has accelerated over the past five years, so might be the conclusions.</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0039" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Recent <line:annotation annotation_id="7760" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> work has updated and extended the existing econometrics-approach literature using a panel of over 130 countries between 1980 and 2008 (see Vujanovic, 2011). The long-run determinates of a country’s reserve holdings are found to be trade openness and the size of the domestic financial sector (as proxied by M2), both of which may capture the self-insurance motives previously referred to. In addition to these factors, changes in <line:annotation annotation_id="7761" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> per capita, the <line:annotation annotation_id="7762" concept-id="123856">exchange rate</line:annotation> regime, <line:annotation annotation_id="7763" concept-id="123856">exchange rate</line:annotation> volatility and the degree of financial openness are associated with changes in the level of a country’s reserve holdings. This analysis suggests that the current ratio of reserves to <line:annotation annotation_id="7764" concept-id="23854">GDP</line:annotation> in the big accumulating countries is significantly above levels that are consistent with the average behaviour of all countries, even after taking into <line:annotation annotation_id="7765" concept-id="126268">account</line:annotation> developments in trade, financial deepening and other pertinent factors. Specifically, <line:annotation annotation_id="7766" concept-id="CHN">China</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="7767" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> record the largest deviations from the levels implied by the long-run cross-country determinants of reserves-to-GDP ratios, followed by South <line:annotation annotation_id="7768" concept-id="KOR">Korea</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="7769" concept-id="ÍND">India</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="7770" concept-id="ZAF">South Africa</line:annotation> (see Figure below). Moreover, when expressed in dollar terms the  global  magnitude  of  these  deviations  stands  out  even  more;  on  average  over</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1070935" instlang="en" indent="n" numbering="y">the three years to 2008, the analysis suggests that <line:annotation annotation_id="7771" concept-id="CHN">China</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="7772" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation> held reserves in excess of what corresponds to average behaviour of around $600 billion and $450 billion, respectively. Furthermore, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that in the case of <line:annotation annotation_id="7773" concept-id="CHN">China</line:annotation>, where the <line:annotation annotation_id="7774" concept-id="126270"><line:annotation annotation_id="7775" concept-id="29210">accumulation</line:annotation></line:annotation> of reserves accelerated after the end of 2008, the deviation from average behaviour eclipsed $1 trillion by 2009. In the case of <line:annotation annotation_id="7776" concept-id="JPN">Japan</line:annotation>, large interventions in the foreign exchange <line:annotation annotation_id="7777" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> in 2003-04 dramatically pushed up the level of international reserves. So while the long-run level implied by average behaviour also climbed through to 2008 (on the back a surge in trade), a large (but declining) positive gap remains.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1070940" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">To the extent that the level of reserves does indeed exceed adequacy ratios in many countries, a greater proportion of these funds could be invested more diversely (and productively), thereby reducing the opportunity cost of holding reserves. This might include <line:annotation annotation_id="7778" concept-id="28709">transferring</line:annotation> a greater proportion of excess reserves to SWFs which typically invest more aggressively and in assets that are less liquid than do central banks (Jeanne, 2007). Indeed, recent moves in that direction by many countries add credence to the view that the current historically unprecedented levels of reserve holdings in some countries are excessive from the stand point of precaution or self-insurance. Diversification in the currencies in which reserves are held might also be prudent as an excessive concentration in one reserve currency could mean that the benefits of self-insurance might be offset by the risk of large <line:annotation annotation_id="7779" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> losses in the event of a major realignment in <line:annotation annotation_id="7780" concept-id="123856">exchange rates</line:annotation>.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1070945" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">That having been said, there are good reasons that the US dollar is the preferred currency in which to hold foreign reserves. Firstly, reserves need to be in a currency that holds its <line:annotation annotation_id="7781" concept-id="28955">value</line:annotation> in a crisis. Secondly, the <line:annotation annotation_id="7782" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> for US dollars is both deep and liquid. Thirdly, to the extent that the <line:annotation annotation_id="7783" concept-id="29803">stock</line:annotation> of reserves serves as insurance against trade and debt shocks, if trade and debt are mostly denominated in US dollars, so therefore should be reserves. Furthermore, if the <line:annotation annotation_id="7784" concept-id="27063">purpose</line:annotation> is to defend a peg to a particular currency, then holding reserves in that counterpart currency would be preferable.</p>

However, these relationships have to be interpreted with caution since they may also reflect some form of reverse causality, as countries that are less prone to crises may be more willing to liberalise and open their financial
system.

But, as shown by Kuhn (1962), periods of continuity are occasionally interrupted by the discovery of anomalies, which lead to a new paradigm, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>a new way of perceiving and analysing the subject of study. Even though the <shortcitation>dismal science</shortcitation> has never seen universal agreement on a single paradigm, a succession of paradigms can still be distinguished in the history of economic policymaking. Each paradigm defines <shortcitation>not only the goals of economic policy and the kind of instruments that can be used to attain them, but also the very nature of the problems they are meant to be addressing</shortcitation> (Hall, 1993, pp. 279).</p>
        <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-p0002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> A prominent paradigm shift took place in the early 1980s when policies became more oriented towards the medium term and the <line:annotation annotation_id="8194" concept-id="29789">supply</line:annotation> side took centre stage in response to the stagflation of the 1970s. Since then there have been further developments in the paradigm, such as those associated with the rational expectations revolution which called for predictability and transparency of policymaking. The <shortcitation><line:annotation annotation_id="8195" concept-id="121631">Great Moderation</line:annotation></shortcitation> of stable growth and <line:annotation annotation_id="8196" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="8197" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="8198" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> since the mid-1990s was seen as evidence of the paradigm’s success. However, favourable headline statistics masked growing underlying imbalances, and when these erupted with the financial crisis of 2008-09, established certainties again broke down and new approaches to policymaking came to the fore.</p>

The chapter looks backward and forward. How have political and economic realities shaped the dominant paradigm? How has the financial crisis led the Organisation to reassess the pre-crisis paradigm? What parts of the pre-crisis paradigm appear to have failed and what parts may be worth preserving?</p>

Since 2005 the annual <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> publication has provided an overview of key recommendations for structural reforms in individual countries, along with a checklist on how countries have responded to them. <line:annotation annotation_id="8216" concept-id="20296">OECD</line:annotation> policy analysis and advice also feeds into the G20, the single-most important global platform for the co-ordination of economic and financial policies since the onset of the crisis. </p>

The <emphasis emph="italic">Jobs Study</emphasis> also reiterated the evident limits to the degree to which macroeconomic policy can be used to reduce <line:annotation annotation_id="8422" concept-id="124079">unemployment</line:annotation>.

When macroeconomic conditions are sound, moreover, structural reforms may be pursued more actively because the transition costs may be less painful. This approach found inspiration in the rational expectations hypothesis, which predicts that <line:annotation annotation_id="8426" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation> will produce optimal outcomes if forward-looking agents can trust policy-makers to be <shortcitation>time consistent</shortcitation>, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>not forced to renege on their commitments other than under exceptional circumstances resulting from major exogenous shocks.</p>

As well, virtually all distressed systemically important <line:annotation annotation_id="8592" concept-id="23545">financial institutions</line:annotation> were rescued following the Lehman Brothers debacle, with central banks and governments providing ample liquidity and balance-sheet support. Many central banks resorted to non-conventional measures (large-scale intervention in <line:annotation annotation_id="8593" concept-id="19624">capital</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="8594" concept-id="114629">markets</line:annotation> so as to reduce the yields on longer maturities) alongside the provision of unlimited liquidity to the banking system.</p>

One lesson to be drawn from this episode is that the Keynesian recipe of active <line:annotation annotation_id="8597" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation> management has been appropriate under conditions of extreme financial stress and a threat of the economy heading to a liquidity trap. However, new challenges have emerged for policymaking, chief among which are the complications that arise when the <line:annotation annotation_id="8598" concept-id="23075">effectiveness</line:annotation> of each strand of policy is heavily affected by the stance of other policies and the need to act under extreme uncertainty.</p>

Substantial efforts were made to support <line:annotation annotation_id="8602" concept-id="23545">financial institutions</line:annotation> including the provision of credit, funding guarantees and liquidity to the financial system, bank recapitalisation using public funds, deposit guarantee extensions and efforts to move troubled assets from banks’ <line:annotation annotation_id="8603" concept-id="20995">balance sheets</line:annotation> to newly created asset management companies.</p>

For example, fiscal support for the financial sector had important ramifications for the transmission of monetary policy. As well, some central banks made large purchases of public debt, often without explicit guarantees against potential losses, while purchases of other assets affected <line:annotation annotation_id="8605" concept-id="27442">resource</line:annotation> allocation, thus blurring the assignments of fiscal and monetary policies. Equally, low policy interest rates and non-standard monetary policies reduced the need for public recapitalisation and for the supervisory authorities to resolve impaired institutions. And structural policies were used to provide support to non-financial <line:annotation annotation_id="8606" concept-id="23156">enterprises</line:annotation> and limit the social and labour-market consequences of the recession even if such settings were not appropriate for the long run.</p>

In principle, and assuming <line:annotation annotation_id="8646" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> expectations stay anchored, the aim of monetary authorities should be to bring policy rates to their neutral levels by the time <line:annotation annotation_id="8647" concept-id="23042">economic slack</line:annotation> is eliminated.

Abundant liquidity provision at near-zero funding costs allows banks to roll over the debt of non-viable <line:annotation annotation_id="8656" concept-id="30723">businesses</line:annotation> or intensify the search for yield, ultimately producing costly misallocation of <line:annotation annotation_id="8657" concept-id="27442">resources</line:annotation> or a build-up of financial fragilities (BIS, 2010). Thus, barring a relapse into recession or <line:annotation annotation_id="8658" concept-id="22581">deflation</line:annotation>, central banks should move policy interest rates to levels that, while still accommodative, are clearly above zero. Meanwhile, unconventional policy measures may remain in place for some more time and could indeed facilitate the normalisation of conventional policy.</p>

The pace of the exit should be commensurate with the state of public finances, the ease of sovereign funding, the strength of the recovery and the scope for monetary policy offsets. It should also take into <line:annotation annotation_id="8660" concept-id="126268">account</line:annotation> that delays in fiscal consolidation might increase interest rates and future growth. A credible fiscal consolidation will likely improve financial <line:annotation annotation_id="8661" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> conditions and hence the monetary transmission mechanism.</p>

Even so, tax increases look unavoidable in view of the size of the consolidation requirements. It is important that consolidation be growth-friendly. For example, raising the <line:annotation annotation_id="8663" concept-id="29738">retirement</line:annotation> age could bring long-term gains while having only limited <line:annotation annotation_id="8664" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> on near-term growth.

However, sometimes there are tradeoffs between the two and a balance has to be struck. It is important to consider though that future benefits of growth-enhancing reform can have immediate positive <line:annotation annotation_id="8669" concept-id="121821">effects</line:annotation> as they allow monetary accommodation to continue for longer, bond yields to fall as the prospects of fiscal sustainability improve and private <line:annotation annotation_id="8670" concept-id="20995">balance sheets</line:annotation> to recover sooner.

But policymakers took the overall benign economic development as evidence that the dominant paradigm worked and this eventually led to the 2008-09 financial crisis. In a globalised economy and financial system, financial vulnerabilities have increased. Booms and busts tend to be recurrent and so are the associated rescues of <line:annotation annotation_id="8687" concept-id="23545">financial institutions</line:annotation> and sovereigns. This, in turn, gives rise to concerns over moral hazard and the political acceptance – if not the legitimacy – of the policy paradigm.</p>

However, in order to preserve and build on the wide-ranging benefits of <line:annotation annotation_id="8692" concept-id="23920">globalisation</line:annotation>, it is essential that the post-crisis paradigm be underpinned by safeguards to maintain financial stability and a strong commitment to sustainable, fair and <shortcitation><line:annotation annotation_id="8693" concept-id="69879">green</line:annotation></shortcitation> growth across the globe. All strands of economic policy – prudential, fiscal, structural and monetary – have a role to play, each within their remits and proper assignments. And all of them need to be co-ordinated internationally so as to achieve that policies reinforce, rather than work against, each other.</p>

Moreover, ending the <line:annotation annotation_id="8701" concept-id="25732">netting</line:annotation> of derivatives positions in financial statements or more generally the possibility of keeping risks off-balance would help to better reveal the exposure to counterparty risk.

Higher margin requirements, including limits to loan-to-value ratios in mortgage lending, could also be envisaged.

Combining both types of policy in a single institution could facilitate such co-ordination, but having separate authorities – each with its area of responsibility and instruments – would offer greater accountability. If the latter set-up were to emerge as the preferred one, an explicit co-ordination mechanism between the two institutions would be needed to indentify the build-up of systemic risks and decide the best response to them.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n22"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0103" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In practice, both types of policy are likely to respond to aggregate <line:annotation annotation_id="8772" concept-id="29357">demand</line:annotation> shocks in a similar manner (easing), but this may not be the case for aggregate <line:annotation annotation_id="8773" concept-id="29789">supply</line:annotation> shocks. Moreover, as noted, if macro-prudential policies are underdeveloped, monetary policy may need to lean against the wind of the asset <line:annotation annotation_id="8774" concept-id="22468">cycle</line:annotation> (White, 2009).

This will require international co-operation, surveillance and communication in setting priorities and in minimising any potential adverse side-effects that can arise from the resulting geographical constellation of policies. One aspect of this is the international effort underway to strengthen prudential frameworks around the world. Beyond this, the role of the G20 <emphasis emph="italic">Framework for Strong Sustainable and Balanced Growth</emphasis> is to identify a combination of macroeconomic, structural and exchange-rate policies that would strengthen growth prospects and helps to achieve more sustainable fiscal positions whilst minimising the risks of renewed widening in global imbalances.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-05-p0116" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Co-operation is also necessary if the international monetary system is to be strengthened. Eventually, real <line:annotation annotation_id="8858" concept-id="123856">exchange rates</line:annotation> will move in line with policy differences as well as different <line:annotation annotation_id="8859" concept-id="24130">growth rates</line:annotation>, <line:annotation annotation_id="8860" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> and fiscal positions. Specifically, over time it would be expected that emerging <line:annotation annotation_id="8861" concept-id="114629">market</line:annotation> economies would experience a real appreciation. If the nominal <line:annotation annotation_id="8862" concept-id="123856">exchange rate</line:annotation> is fixed, the required changes have to come through <line:annotation annotation_id="8863" concept-id="29216">adjustments</line:annotation> to wages and <line:annotation annotation_id="8864" concept-id="124073"><line:annotation annotation_id="8865" concept-id="26675"><line:annotation annotation_id="8866" concept-id="29658">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation>, which can be costly as it would risk de-anchoring <line:annotation annotation_id="8867" concept-id="123834">inflation</line:annotation> expectations.

Hence reforms are needed to facilitate the movement of <line:annotation annotation_id="8868" concept-id="123856">exchange rates</line:annotation> in line with economic fundamentals so as to ensure that nominal exchange-rate <line:annotation annotation_id="8869" concept-id="29216">adjustment</line:annotation> acts as a safety valve.
