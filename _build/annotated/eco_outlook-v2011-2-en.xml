      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0001" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The global economy has deteriorated significantly since our previous <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>. Advanced economies are slowing down and the euro area appears to be in a mild recession. Concerns about sovereign debt sustainability in the European monetary union are becoming increasingly widespread. Recent contagion to countries thought to have relatively solid public finances could massively escalate economic disruption if not addressed. <line:annotation annotation_id="12" concept-id="124079" concept-name="unemployment">Unemployment</line:annotation> remains very high in many <line:annotation annotation_id="13" concept-id="20296" concept-name="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</line:annotation> economies and, ominously, long-term <line:annotation annotation_id="14" concept-id="124079" concept-name="unemployment">unemployment</line:annotation> is becoming increasingly common. Emerging economies are still growing at a healthy pace, but their <line:annotation annotation_id="15" concept-id="24130" concept-name="growth rate">growth rates</line:annotation> are also moderating. In these countries falls in <line:annotation annotation_id="16" concept-id="29312" concept-name="commodities">commodity</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="17" concept-id="124073" concept-name="prices"><line:annotation annotation_id="18" concept-id="26675" concept-name="price"><line:annotation annotation_id="19" concept-id="29658" concept-name="price">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> and the slower global growth have started to mitigate inflationary pressures. More recently, international trade growth has weakened significantly. Contrary to what was expected earlier this year, the global economy is not out of the woods. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Many factors underpin this assessment. The headwinds of deleveraging in the financial and <line:annotation annotation_id="20" concept-id="24019" concept-name="government sector">government sectors</line:annotation> remain with us. Likewise, imbalances within the euro area, which reflect deep-seated fiscal, financial and structural problems, have not been adequately resolved. Above all, confidence has dropped sharply as scepticism has grown that euro area policy <line:annotation annotation_id="21" concept-id="25196" concept-name="maker">makers</line:annotation> can deal effectively with the key challenges they face. Serious downside risks remain in the euro area, linked to the possibility of a sovereign default and its cross-border <line:annotation annotation_id="22" concept-id="121821" concept-name="effect">effects</line:annotation> on creditors, and loss of confidence in sovereign debt <line:annotation annotation_id="23" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">markets</line:annotation> and the monetary union itself. Another serious downside risk is that no action will be agreed upon to counter the pre-programmed fiscal tightening in the <line:annotation annotation_id="24" concept-id="USA" concept-name="United States">United States</line:annotation>, which could tip the economy into a recession that monetary policy can do little to counter.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0003" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">More than usual, world economic prospects depend on events, the nature and timing of which are highly uncertain. The projections presented in this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> portray a <line:annotation annotation_id="25" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation> that rests on the assumptions that monetary policy remains very supportive (and, in some places, becomes more so), that sovereign debt and banking sector problems in the euro area are contained and that excessive fiscal tightening will be avoided. From the second half of 2012, confidence is assumed to recover gradually as it becomes clearer that worst-case outcomes have been avoided. Near-term <line:annotation annotation_id="26" concept-id="26237" concept-name="output">output</line:annotation> growth is subdued in the <line:annotation annotation_id="27" concept-id="20296" concept-name="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</line:annotation> economies and at below-trend rates in the major emerging-market economies, developments which are likely to be associated with further short-term weakening of sentiment and confidence. In some economies, especially the euro area, a mild recession is projected in the near term. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0004" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Alternative <line:annotation annotation_id="28" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenarios</line:annotation> are possible, and may be even more likely than the <line:annotation annotation_id="29" concept-id="89546" concept-name="baseline">baseline</line:annotation>. A downside <line:annotation annotation_id="30" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation> would be characterised by materialisation of negative risks and the absence of adequate policy action to deal with them. An upside <line:annotation annotation_id="31" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation> could arise if policy action were successful in boosting confidence and no significant negative events occurred. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0005" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the downside <line:annotation annotation_id="32" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation>, the implications of a major negative event in the euro area will depend on the channels at work and their virulence. The results could range from relatively benign to highly devastating outcomes. A large negative event would, however, most likely send the <line:annotation annotation_id="33" concept-id="20296" concept-name="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</line:annotation> area as a whole into recession, with marked declines in <line:annotation annotation_id="34" concept-id="29213" concept-name="activity">activity</line:annotation> in the <line:annotation annotation_id="35" concept-id="USA" concept-name="United States">United States</line:annotation> and <line:annotation annotation_id="36" concept-id="JPN" concept-name="Japan">Japan</line:annotation>, and prolong and deepen the recession in the euro area. <line:annotation annotation_id="37" concept-id="124079" concept-name="unemployment">Unemployment</line:annotation> would rise still further. The emerging <line:annotation annotation_id="38" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> economies would not be immune, with global trade volumes falling strongly, and the <line:annotation annotation_id="39" concept-id="28955" concept-name="value">value</line:annotation> of their international asset holdings being hit by weaker financial asset <line:annotation annotation_id="40" concept-id="124073" concept-name="prices"><line:annotation annotation_id="41" concept-id="26675" concept-name="price"><line:annotation annotation_id="42" concept-id="29658" concept-name="price">prices</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation>. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0006" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">What would be required for an upside <line:annotation annotation_id="43" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation> to materialise? A credible commitment by euro area governments that contagion would be blocked, backed by clearly adequate <line:annotation annotation_id="44" concept-id="27442" concept-name="resource">resources</line:annotation>. To eliminate contagion risks, banks will have to be well capitalised. Decisive policies and the appropriate institutional responses will have to be put in place to ensure smooth financing at reasonable interest rates for sovereigns. This calls for rapid, credible and substantial increases in the capacity of the EFSF together with, or including, greater use of the ECB <line:annotation annotation_id="45" concept-id="20995" concept-name="balance sheet">balance sheet</line:annotation>. Such forceful policy action, complemented by appropriate governance reform to offset moral hazard, could result in a significant boost to growth in the euro area and the global economy.</p>

In Europe, such policies are also needed to make progress in resolving the underlying structural imbalances that lie at the heart of the euro area crisis. Deep structural reforms will be instrumental in strengthening the <line:annotation annotation_id="50" concept-id="29216" concept-name="adjustment">adjustment</line:annotation> mechanisms in labour and <line:annotation annotation_id="51" concept-id="26830" concept-name="product">product</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="52" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">markets</line:annotation> that, together with a robust repair of the financial system, are essential for the good functioning of the monetary union.

The largest benefits would be felt in the euro area, though these could take some time to emerge. Stronger <line:annotation annotation_id="59" concept-id="29213" concept-name="activity">activity</line:annotation> and trade, and the consequent rise in asset <line:annotation annotation_id="60" concept-id="28955" concept-name="value">values</line:annotation> in the <line:annotation annotation_id="61" concept-id="20296" concept-name="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</line:annotation> economies, should boost <line:annotation annotation_id="62" concept-id="29213" concept-name="activity">activity</line:annotation> in the emerging <line:annotation annotation_id="63" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> economies as well. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0009" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In view of the great uncertainty policy <line:annotation annotation_id="64" concept-id="25196" concept-name="maker">makers</line:annotation> now confront, they must be prepared to face the worst. The <line:annotation annotation_id="65" concept-id="20296" concept-name="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</line:annotation> Strategic Response identifies country-specific policy actions that need to be implemented if the downside <line:annotation annotation_id="66" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation> materialises: the financial sector must be stabilised and the social safety <line:annotation annotation_id="67" concept-id="25732" concept-name="net">net</line:annotation> protected; further monetary policy easing should be undertaken; and fiscal support should be provided where this is practical. At the same time, stronger fiscal frameworks should be adopted to reassure <line:annotation annotation_id="68" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">markets</line:annotation> that the public finances can be brought under control.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0010" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Beyond this, a wide range of structural measures, which are desirable in their own right, will become urgent. While priorities vary from country to country, such policies include the removal of barriers in <line:annotation annotation_id="69" concept-id="26830" concept-name="product">product</line:annotation> and labour <line:annotation annotation_id="70" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">markets</line:annotation> that inhibit <line:annotation annotation_id="71" concept-id="22999" concept-name="economic activity"><line:annotation annotation_id="72" concept-id="124299" concept-name="economic activity">economic <line:annotation annotation_id="73" concept-id="29213" concept-name="activity">activity</line:annotation></line:annotation></line:annotation> and employment. Appropriate labour <line:annotation annotation_id="74" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> policies are needed to deal with the consequences of <line:annotation annotation_id="75" concept-id="124079" concept-name="unemployment">unemployment</line:annotation> which is turning from cyclical to structural, thereby sapping potential growth, hitting confidence and undermining public finances. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The difference between the upside and the downside <line:annotation annotation_id="76" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenarios</line:annotation> reflects the impact of credible, confidence building policy action. Such action, as we have seen, requires measures to be implemented at the euro area level as well as at the country level throughout the <line:annotation annotation_id="77" concept-id="20296" concept-name="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</line:annotation>, especially in the structural policy domain. In the case of a downside <line:annotation annotation_id="78" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation>, policy action would clearly be needed to avoid the worst outcomes. But then the question arises of why policy efforts are not taken to deliver the upside <line:annotation annotation_id="79" concept-id="27661" concept-name="scenario">scenario</line:annotation> even if the worst case does not materialise. Why, in other words, should we settle for less?</p>

In addition, there is a lack of clarity in the treatment of sovereign bonds held in the banking book that are available for sale: under international financial reporting standards they are expected to be marked to <line:annotation annotation_id="797" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation>, but some countries are reported to have applied <shortcitation>prudential filters</shortcitation> allowing banks to <line:annotation annotation_id="798" concept-id="28955" concept-name="value">value</line:annotation> them at amortised cost for the <line:annotation annotation_id="799" concept-id="27063" concept-name="purpose">purpose</line:annotation> of calculating compliance with regulatory <line:annotation annotation_id="800" concept-id="19624" concept-name="capital">capital</line:annotation> requirements. Another source of uncertainty about banks’ financial statements relates to the treatment of their credit default swap (CDS) exposures as it appeared in October that a significant euro area bank had previously classified them as guarantees (which can receive a special accounting treatment), meaning that it did not have to recognise mark-to-market losses. There are also concerns that some banks outside the euro area could have large exposures to vulnerable euro area countries and banks, especially through credit default swaps (see below).</p>

For instance enhanced purchases of bonds in the secondary <line:annotation annotation_id="827" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> could be required if the risk insurance available on newly issued sovereign debt resulted in existing debt, without such risk insurance, coming under increased pressure.

              <p id="OCDEid1181727" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The feasibility of the schemes remains unclear. In particular, the success of the proposed SPVs will depend on the extent to which investors are willing to finance the sovereign debt of vulnerable countries at yields which do not threaten debt sustainability. As any extension of the sovereign guarantees underpinning the EFSF was ruled out, possible leverage and costs thereof remain dependent on the extent to which bond <line:annotation annotation_id="830" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> contagion to the countries that guarantee the EFSF can be contained.

The significant widening of French government bond spreads in the wake of French bank funding stress since mid-2011 illustrates the potential strength of this crisis amplification channel.</p>

Guaranteeing a certain percentage of all existing and new debt should lead to a reduction in yields, although the impact is uncertain and depends on which combination of loss-given-default and probability of default is reflected in current spreads and on how the probability of default would be reassessed after the introduction of a guarantee. As an illustrative example, Italian government bond spreads over swaps
as of 18 November 2011 can be interpreted as reflecting an implied probability of default of 6.1% a year over the next ten years using the value-weighted average loss-given-default rate of 69%, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e.</emphasis> the average of the episodes of default surveyed in Moody’s (2011). Under this assumption, a 20% guarantee would reduce yields by less than 140 basis points. If, alternatively, loss-given-default is assumed to be equal to the un-weighted average of 47% in the study, the associated implied probability of default is 10.9% a year and the yield reduction for a 20% guarantee would reach almost 200 basis points. </p></fnote> In the longer term, jointly issued or jointly guaranteed euro-bonds could achieve the same <line:annotation annotation_id="1174" concept-id="121821" concept-name="effect">effects</line:annotation> but would likely take time to introduce and would raise similar types of moral hazard concerns.</p>

Because of practical, legal and political economy barriers, the ECB would most likely have to play a key role in providing the required <line:annotation annotation_id="1209" concept-id="27442" concept-name="resource">resources</line:annotation> – possibly via the EFSF which would help ensure a more appropriate allocation of credit risk.

In particular, it is necessary to establish mechanisms to counter the potential moral hazard from intervening to block contagion. There are various options available to attain that end: stronger adherence to central rules and automatic penalties for non-compliance, <emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>monetary fines or the federation taking control of national VAT rates to attain <line:annotation annotation_id="1216" concept-id="94549" concept-name="targeting">targets</line:annotation>; blue/red bonds that would provide countries with incentives to prevent their debt exceeding a certain limit where they could no longer benefit from low interest rates backed by a federal guarantee; increased use of <line:annotation annotation_id="1217" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> mechanisms to discipline fiscal behaviour, which would require establishing a framework for orderly sovereign default; etc. These options differ in terms of the extent of administrative and <line:annotation annotation_id="1218" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> control, and the ultimate arrangement will depend on members’ preferences in these matters, but the multiplicity of possible solutions should not delay the adoption of adequate arrangements.

Increased transparency would be facilitated by independent fiscal councils that would prepare economic projections to be used as a basis for the budget and the monitoring of fiscal outcomes relative to plans. Multi-year budgeting could prove to be a useful tool to link short-term budgetary developments to medium-term <line:annotation annotation_id="1465" concept-id="94549" concept-name="targeting">targets</line:annotation>.</p>

This is due to both the favourable cyclical situation up to now and improvements in the structural balance.

The government’s deficit <line:annotation annotation_id="2859" concept-id="94549" concept-name="targeting">target</line:annotation> will be missed owing to the deeper than expected recession and slow implementation of some critical structural fiscal reforms.

The draft budget, which incorporates commitments agreed with the IMF and the EU, foresees a primary surplus for first time after many years. The <line:annotation annotation_id="2864" concept-id="20296" concept-name="Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development">OECD</line:annotation> projection is for a deficit of 9% of <line:annotation annotation_id="2865" concept-id="23854" concept-name="gross domestic product">GDP</line:annotation> in 2011 and 7% of <line:annotation annotation_id="2866" concept-id="23854" concept-name="gross domestic product">GDP</line:annotation> in 2012, declining to 5¼ per cent of <line:annotation annotation_id="2867" concept-id="23854" concept-name="gross domestic product">GDP</line:annotation> in 2013. This implies that the debt-GDP ratio will continue to rise.

          <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s35-03-p0506" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The countercyclical fiscal stimulus imparted in 2009 was withdrawn in 2010, and the headline fiscal balance improved further in 2011. An additional improvement is expected in 2012 despite below-potential growth, as the fiscal stance is set to tighten in order to preserve hard-won fiscal credibility. To maintain confidence in the soundness of monetary policy, effective communication on the new policy goals and comprehensive and timely reporting of outcomes are important. The highly conservative financial prudential regulatory framework is also essential to maintain confidence in the current unstable international financial environment.</p>

New restrictions have also been put on mortgage lending and the bank regulator has forced banks to bring significant amounts of lending back onto their <line:annotation annotation_id="4271" concept-id="20995" concept-name="balance sheet">balance sheets</line:annotation>. Moreover, the increase in regulated interest rates recorded so far understates the degree of financial tightness, as the PBoC has allowed <line:annotation annotation_id="4272" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> rates to increase substantially more than the administered rates. This encouraged purchases of financial <line:annotation annotation_id="4273" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> <line:annotation annotation_id="4274" concept-id="26830" concept-name="product">products</line:annotation>, similar to money <line:annotation annotation_id="4275" concept-id="114629" concept-name="market">market</line:annotation> funds, which offer higher rates of return than bank deposits.

However, the restrictions on off-balance sheet lending led to a marked fall in the rate of growth of total credit <line:annotation annotation_id="4279" concept-id="29436" concept-name="flow">flows</line:annotation> in the third quarter. Small and medium-sized <line:annotation annotation_id="4280" concept-id="30723" concept-name="business">businesses</line:annotation> face more difficulty in obtaining finance. In October, the State Council announced that, to ease these problems, banks should ensure that the share of SMEs in total lending does not fall. It also increased the size of special SME financing funds.</p>
