Capital stocks are characterised by persistence over time, a capacity to store value, and an ability to generate a stream of benefits to society over time. Capital accumulates slowly through investment, can depreciate over time, and can be depleted in a number of ways (e.g. through consumption, neglect or damage).

The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. We work with governments to understand what drives economic, social and environmental change. We measure productivity and global flows of trade and investment. We analyse and compare data to predict future trends. We set international standards on a wide range of things, from agriculture and tax to the safety of chemicals. We look, too, at issues that directly affect the lives of ordinary people, like how much they pay in taxes and social security, and how much leisure time they can take. We compare how different countries’ school systems are readying their young people for modern life, and how different countries’ pension systems will look after their citizens in old age. Drawing on facts and real-life experience, we recommend policies designed to make the lives of ordinary people better. We work with business, through the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, and with labour, through the Trade Union Advisory Committee. We have active contacts as well with other civil society organisations. The common thread of our work is a shared commitment to market economies backed by democratic institutions and focused on the wellbeing of all citizens. Along the way, we also set out to make life harder for the terrorists, tax dodgers, crooked businessmen and others whose actions undermine a fair and open.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Abnormal obsolescence is the loss in value on an asset due to a fall in demand for that type of asset that could not have been foreseen when the asset was acquired. Abnormal obsolescence may occur because of a new invention or discovery which destroys the market for the asset or because a shift in relative prices makes it uneconomical to continue using the asset. It is not included in consumption of fixed capital but in “other changes in nonfinancial asset n.e.c.” in the “Other changes in assets account”. Abnormal obsolescence is a synonym for “unforeseen obsolescence”.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>This is a practice where the price of a product is calculated by a firm on the basis of its direct costs per unit of output plus a markup to cover overhead costs and profits. The overhead costs are generally calculated assuming less than full capacity operation of a plant in order to allow for fluctuating levels of production and costs. Full cost pricing is often used by firms as it is very difficult to calculate the precise demand for a product and establish a market price. Empirical studies indicate that full cost pricing methods are widely employed by business firms.  </p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Additivity is a property pertaining to a set of interdependent index numbers related by definition or by accounting constraints. An aggregate is defined as the sum of its components. Additivity requires this identity to be preserved when the values of both an aggregate and its components in some reference period are extrapolated over time using a set of volume index numbers. Although desirable from an accounting viewpoint, additivity is actually a very restrictive property. As already noted, Laspeyres volume indices are additive because extrapolating the base period values by Laspeyres volume indices is equivalent to revaluing quantities in later periods by the same set of base period prices. Additivity implies that, at each level of aggregation, the volume index for an aggregate takes the form of a weighted arithmetic average of the volume indices for its components that uses their base period values as weights. This requirement virtually defines the Laspeyres index. Other volume indices in common use are therefore not additive.</p></div>

  <h3 class="term-name">adjustment for the change in the net equity of households in pension fund reserves</h3>
<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>in order to reconcile this treatment with the fact that households are treated in the financial accounts and balance sheets of the System as owning the reserves of private funded pension schemes, both autonomous and non-autonomous, it is necessary to introduce an adjustment item to ensure that the balance of pension contributions over pension receipts (i.e., of transfers payable over transfers receivable) does not enter into household saving. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to add back pension contributions to, and subtract pension receipts from, the disposable income, or adjusted disposable income, of households recorded in the secondary distribution of income accounts in order to get back to a figure for the saving of households that is the same as what it would have been if pension contributions and pension receipts had not been recorded as current transfers in the secondary distribution of income account. The necessary adjustment item is therefore equal to: the total value of the actual social contributions payable into private funded pension schemes plus the total value of contribution supplements payable out of the property income attributed to insurance policy holders (i.e., holders of pension rights) minus the value of the associated service charges minus the total value of the pensions paid out as social insurance benefits by private funded pension schemes. This adjustment item is equal to the change in the net equity of households in pension funds described in paragraphs 11.93 to 11.96 of chapter XI. It must be added to the disposable income, or adjusted disposable income, of households before calculating saving in order to reconcile the saving of households with the change in their net equity in life insurance reserves and pension funds recorded in the financial account of the System. Opposite adjustments are, of course, needed in the use of income accounts of the insurance enterprises, autonomous pension funds or employers maintaining non-autonomous pension funds. These adjustments can affect non-resident institutional units, both households and pension funds.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Refers to the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a given product due to the percentage change in the price of another "related" product. If all prices are allowed to vary, the quantity demanded of product X is dependent not only on its own price (see elasticity of demand) but upon the prices of other products as well. The concept of cross price elasticity of demand is used to classify whether or not products are "substitutes" or "complements". It is also used in market definition to group products that are likely to compete with one another.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>A measure of how closely aligned the timing of movements in activity are for two countries over their business cycles. The cross-correlation statistic for two economic time series can range from -1 to 1. In general, the closer the cross-correlation is to value of 1 the more in phase and synchronised the business cycles will be. A value of -1 would indicate that the two series move perfectly in a counter-cyclical direction. A value near zero indicates that there is no statistical relationship between the series.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Is an incorporated enterprise in which a foreign investor owns 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power or an unincorporated enterprise in which a foreign investor has equivalent ownership. Ownership of 10 per cent of the ordinary shares or voting stock is the criterion for determining the existence of a direct investment relationship. An “effective voice in the management”, as evidenced by an ownership of at least 10 per cent, implies that the direct investor is able to influence, or participate in, the management of an enterprise absolute control by the foreign investor is not required.Direct investment enterprises comprise:subsidiaries (an enterprise in which a non-resident investor owns more than 50 per cent) associates (an enterprise in which a non-resident investor owns between 10 and 50 per cent) and branches (unincorporated enterprises wholly or jointly owned by a non-resident investor) that are either directly or indirectly owned by the direct investor.When the 10 per cent ownership requirement for establishing a direct investment link with an enterprise is met, certain other enterprises that are related to the first enterprise are also regarded as direct investment enterprises. Hence the definition of direct investment enterprise extends to the branches and subsidiaries of subsidiaries of the direct investor (so-called “indirectly owned direct investment enterprises”). The OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Investment, and the IMF Balance of Payments Textbook and Balance of Payments Compilation Guide describe the scope of enterprises, both directly and indirectly owned, that should be included in the definition. The OECD’s specification of this group of enterprises is referred to as the “Fully Consolidated System”.</p></div>

In contrast, a positive externality or external economy may arise from the construction of a road which opens a new area for housing, commercial development, tourism, etc.</p></div>

In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period. Two main methods are adopted in practice. The first, referred to as &ldquo;quantity revaluation&rdquo;, is based on a methodology consistent with the above theory (i.e., by multiplying the current period quantity by the base period price). The second, commonly referred to as &ldquo;price deflation&rdquo;, involves dividing price indexes into the observed values to obtain the volume estimate. The price indexes used are built up from the prices of the major items contributing to each value.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>The quantity demanded of a particular product depends not only on its own price and on the price of other related products, but also on factors such as income. The purchase of certain commodities may be particularly sensitive to changes in nominal and real income. The concept of income elasticity of demand therefore measures the percentage change in quantity demanded of a given product due to a percentage change in income.

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>A coherent, consistent and integrated set of macroeconomic accounts, balance sheets and tables based on a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, the rationale behind national accounts is summarised in the following three paragraphs, which have been reproduced from the Introduction to SNA93. See also technical note by the OECD Statistics Directorate on the OECD web site. For a description of the data used in individual countries see note to Annex Table 1 . National accounts provide a comprehensive accounting framework within which economic data can be compiled and presented in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policy-making. The accounts themselves present in a condensed way a great mass of detailed information, organized according to economic principles and perceptions, about the working of an economy. They provide a comprehensive and detailed record of the complex economic activities taking place within an economy and of the interaction between the different economic agents, and groups of agents, that takes place on markets or elsewhere. In practice the accounts are compiled for a succession of time periods, thus providing a continuing flow of information that is indispensable for the monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the performance of an economy over time. The accounts provides information not only about economic activities, but also about the levels of an economy's productive assets and the wealth of its inhabitants at particular points of time. Finally, they also include an external account that displays the links between an economy and the rest of the world. The accounts may be implemented at different levels of aggregation: at the level of individual economic agents, or institutional units for groups of such units, or institutional sectors or at the level of the total economy. In order to understand the workings of the economy, it is essential to be able to observe and analyse the economic interactions taking place between the different sectors of the economy. Certain key aggregate statistics, such as gross domestic product (GDP), that are widely used as indicators of economic activity at the level of the total economy, are defined within the System, but the calculation of such aggregates has long ceased to be the primary purpose for compiling the accounts. For an explanation of how GDP is constructed see note to Annex Table 2. The System is built around a sequence of interconnected flow accounts linked to different types of economic activity taking place within a given period of time, together with balance sheets that record the values of the stocks of assets and liabilities held by institutional units or sectors at the beginning and end of the period. Each flow account relates to a particular kind of activity such as production, or the generation, distribution, redistribution or use of income. Each account is balanced by introducing a balancing item defined residually as the difference between the total resources and uses recorded on the two sides of the account. The balancing item from one account is carried forward as the first item in the following account, thereby making the sequence of accounts an articulated whole. The balancing items typically encapsulate the net result of the activities covered by the accounts in question and are therefore economic constructs of considerable interest and analytical significance - for example, value added, disposable income and saving. There is also a strong link between the flow accounts and the balance sheets, as all the changes occurring over time that affect the assets or liabilities held by institutional units or sectors are systematically recorded in one or another of the flow accounts. The closing balance sheet is fully determined by the opening balance sheet and the transactions or other flows recorded in the sequence of accounts.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Externalities refers to situations when the effect of production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs or benefits on others which are not reflected in the prices charged for the goods and services being provided. Pollution is an obvious example of a negative externality, also termed an external diseconomy. Chemicals dumped by an industrial plant into a lake may kill fish and plant life and affect the livelihood of fishermen and farmers nearby. In contrast, a positive externality or external economy may arise from the construction of a road which opens a new area for housing, commercial development, tourism, etc. The invention of the transistor generated numerous positive externalities in the manufacture of modern telecommunication, stereo and computer equipment. Externalities arise when property rights cannot be clearly assigned.</p></div>

  <h3 class="term-name">nominal GDP</h3>
<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>The adoption of new national account systems, SNA93 or ESA95, has been proceeding at an uneven pace among OECD member countries, both with respect to variables and the time period covered. As a consequence, there are breaks in many national series. Moreover, a growing number of countries are using chain-weighted price indices to calculate real GDP and expenditures components. The figures on individual demand components follow, in general, the SNA definitions. One important deviation from the Standardised System is the line "public investment" which includes, whenever possible, fixed capital formation by both general government and government-owned and controlled enterprises. The definition and coverage of the latter may vary between countries. Private consumption expenditure: Final consumption expenditure of households and private non-profit institutions serving households. Gross fixed capital formation: The outlays (purchases and own-account production) of industries, producers of government services and producers of private non-profit services to households, on additions of new durable goods (commodities) to their stocks of fixed assets less their net sales of similar second-hand and scrapped goods. Excluded are the outlays of government services on durable goods for military use. Included are acquisitions of reproducible and non-reproducible durable goods, except land, mineral deposits, timber tracts and the like, for civilian use work-in-progress on construction projects capital repairs outlays on the improvement of land and on the development and extension of timber tracts, plantations, vineyards, etc. which take considerably more than a year to become productive, until they become productive the acquisition of breeding stock, draught animals, dairy cattle and the like and the transfer costs in connection with purchases and sales of land, mineral deposits, timber tracts, etc. Some countries, United States, Canada and France use hedonic price indices to deflate current-price values of investment in certain information and communication technology products such as computers. National account data do not always have a sectoral breakdown of investment expenditures, and for some countries data are estimated by the OECD.</p></div>

  <h3 class="term-name">purchasing power parity (PPP)</h3>
<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>International comparisons of GDP depend on two conditions being met. The first is that the basis of calculating GDP is consistent for the countries under comparison. The second is that the unit in which GDP is expressed, the numeraire, is comparable. The simplest way of comparing the GDP of two different countries is to convert each amount (or, even better, the amount per capita) to a common currency using official exchange rates. However, this is widely recognised as being inadequate because market exchange rates do not adequately reflect the comparative purchasing power of local currencies in their own markets. The concept of the purchasing power parity (PPP) was developed to provide an alternative conversion factor for GDP, so that internationally comparable price and volume comparisons of GDP could be established. PPPs are the rates of currency conversion which equalise the purchasing power of different currencies. This means that a given sum of money, when converted into different currencies at the PPP rates, will buy the same basket of goods and services in all countries. In other words, PPPs are the rates of currency conversion which eliminate the differences in price levels between countries. Thus, when expenditures on GDP for different countries are converted into a common currency by means of PPPs, they are expressed, in effect, at the same set of international prices so that comparisons between countries reflect only differences in the volume of goods and services purchased. Expenditures converted to a common currency using exchange rates, on the other hand, reflect not only differences in the volumes purchased in the different countries, but also the differences in price levels between the countries. Exchange rates do not reflect the relative purchasing powers of different currencies and are not, therefore, the appropriate currency conversion rates with which to make international comparisons of volume. Expenditures on GDP converted at exchange rates remain essentially nominal measures the same expenditures converted using PPPs are real measures. The PPPs produced by the OECD do not refer solely to domestically-produced tradable goods and services valued at export prices. Instead, they have been calculated specifically for statistical purposes in order to enable international price and volume comparisons to be made for expenditure on GDP and its components. As such, they refer to the entire range of final goods and services which make up GDP as a whole including many items, such as construction and government services, which are not traded. Moreover, they are valued at domestic market prices and are calculated using expenditure weights that primarily reflect domestic demand. Both real and nominal expenditures are presented in OECD publications. The real values are expressed at international prices in US dollars the nominal values are expressed at national prices in both US dollars and national currency (the choice of the US dollar as the common unit of currency is purely a matter of convention which has no effect on the relative positions of countries.)</p></div>
<div class="term-source">OECD/Economics Department/Economics Glossary/2005]</p><p>Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalise the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries.

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Broadly defined as imposition of rules by government, backed by the use of penalties that are intended specifically to modify the economic behaviour of individuals and firms in the private sector. Various regulatory instruments or targets exist. Prices, output, rate of return (in the form of profits, margins or commissions), disclosure of information, standards and ownership ceilings are among those frequently used. Different rationales for economic regulation have been put forward. One is to curb potential market power and increase efficiency or avoid duplication of facilities in cases of natural monopoly. Another is to protect consumers and maintain quality and other standards including ethical standards in the case of professional services provided by doctors, lawyers, etc. Regulations may also be enacted to prevent excessive competition and protect suppliers from unstable output and low price conditions, to promote employment and more equitable distribution of income.</p></div>

Because reinvested earnings are not actually distributed to the direct investor but rather increase the direct investor’s investment in its affiliate, an entry that is equal to that made in the direct investment income account but of opposite sign is entered in the direct investment transactions account. In the direct investment income account, this transaction is referred to as “reinvested earnings”, while in the direct investment transactions account, this transaction is referred to as “reinvestment of earnings”.</div>

This theorem says that, under certain conditions, each of the standard auction designs (ascending, descending, first-price sealed-bid and second-price sealed bid) will yield the same expected revenue and results in each bidder making the same expected payment as a function of her indication. Roughly speaking, the conditions are that bidders are risk neutral, that their indications are independent and drawn from the same distribution (which implies inter alia that bidders are symmetric). The result applies to private values and to those common values models in which indications are independent. Note that, in general, this result does not apply to common values auctions. Klemperer (2004) contains an easy-to-follow proof and discussion of this theorem.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>The Pact is the framework, adopted in 1997, for the co-ordination of fiscal policy across EU States. It stipulates that Member States adhere to the medium-term objective of budgetary positions "close to balance or in surplus". This is judged to be necessary to allow automatic stabilisers to work during a normal downturn without taking the budget deficit above the 3 per cent of GDP limit. A general government deficit exceeding this threshold can lead to pecuniary penalties unless the European Council judges it to be temporary and there are special circumstances. Every year, each Member State draws up a stability (for the euro area Members) or convergence (for the others) programme setting out the key elements of fiscal policy over the next few years. The programme is submitted to the Commission and, based on the latter's recommendations, adopted by the European Council with a published opinion.</p></div>

  <h3 class="term-name">stabiliser</h3>
<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>A budgetary stabiliser mechanism was adopted as part of a policy reform package in February 1988. The stabiliser system influences the setting of administered prices by linking them to a global threshold level of production (maximum guaranteed quantity, MGQ). An automatic reduction in the intervention price (or in production aids, depending on the commodity) is triggered if annual production exceeds the MGQ. In oilseeds the reduction is a function of the amount by which the MGQ is exceeded. In cereals, the price reduction is 3 per cent of the intervention price established for the following crop year. Sectors for which an MGQ is defined include cereals, olive oil, rapeseed, sunflower seeds, soya, pulses, tobacco, cotton and sheepmeat.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Working day or trading adjustments refer to the correction for differences in the number of working or trading days in a given month or quarter which differ from year to year which will impact upon the level of activity in that month or quarter for flow series or the sort / type of day for stock series. In most countries working day adjustment and trading day adjustment are used as synonyms. Context: The number of working or trading days in a given month or quarter can vary significantly for each statistical domain (e.g. production, merchandise trade) because of differing institutional arrangements, trade specific holidays, etc.). Some countries also include bridging effects in working day adjustments. These result from people taking holidays, for example, on Mondays and Fridays when an official public holiday occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays respectively. The type of working / trading day adjustment carried out needs to be tailored to the cultural and institutional environment operating within individual countries. In the United States, for example, working day adjustment classifies the days of the week into workdays (Monday through to Friday) and non-workdays (Sat. and Sun.) and thus the seasonal adjustment estimates two factors – workday and non-workday. Trading day adjustment (as performed in the US at least) allows for a different effect for each day of the week and computes seven factors – a Monday factor, a Tuesday factor and so on. Essentially, trading day adjustment is a more fine tuned seasonal adjustment method to account for calendar variation. In other countries there may be very distinct differences between workdays and non-workdays in the amount of business conducted, but not so much difference between Mondays, Tuesdays, through the Fridays. The US on the other hand, has distinctly different patterns of activity each day of the week and methods used in that country try to account for that difference.

Therefore, direct investment flows should be compiled only in respect of the immediate host/investing country. The regional allocation of the international investment position statement should also be compiled on the basis of the immediate host or investing country. However, it is suggested that the stock of direct investment net assets could also be compiled in respect of the ultimate host or controlling country, as supplementary information.

<p>The cost of funds used for financing a business. Cost of capital depends on the mode of financing used – it refers to the cost of equity if the business is financed solely through equity, or to the cost of debt if it is financed solely through debt. Many companies use a combination of debt and equity to finance their businesses, and for such companies, their overall cost of capital is derived from a weighted average of all capital sources, widely known as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Since the cost of capital represents a hurdle rate that a company must overcome before it can generate value, it is extensively used in the capital budgeting process to determine whether the company should proceed with a project.</p><p>[ENV/EPOC/WPCID(2014)6] </p>

  <h3 class="term-name">X-inefficiency</h3>
<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>In The Wealth of Nations published in 1776, Adam Smith observed that "Monopoly... is a great enemy to good management." This insight explicitly recognized that the problem of monopoly is not only one of price but also one of costs. While monopoly may provide the basis for extracting higher prices from customers, the lack of competitive stimulus may raise the costs of producing the goods and services it sells. The lack of incentives or competitive pressures may lead monopolistic firms to neglect minimizing unit costs of production, i.e., to tolerate "X- inefficiency" (phrase coined by H. Leibenstein). Included in X-inefficiency are wasteful expenditures such as maintenance of excess capacity, luxurious executive benefits, political lobbying seeking protection and favourable regulations, and litigation.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>A joint venture involves the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other institutional unit in which each party legally has joint control over the activities of the unit.

As an institutional unit, the joint venture may enter into contracts in its own name and raise finance for its own purposes. If R&amp;D joint ventures are stand-alone units, they should also be classified on the basis of the units they predominantly serve, taking whenever possible into account the established practice of the system of national accounts.</div>
<div class="term-source">OECD/Frascati Manual/2015]<br /><br />A joint venture is an association of firms or individuals formed to undertake a specific business project. It is similar to a partnership, but limited to a specific project (such as producing a specific product or doing research in a specific area. Joint ventures are now becoming more prevalent in the development of new technologies. (OECD/Glossary of Industrial Organisation, Economics &amp; Competition/1993) A joint venture is a contractual agreement between two or more parties for the purpose of executing a business undertaking in which the parties agree to share in the profits and losses of the enterprise as well as the capital formation and contribution of operating inputs or costs. It is similar to a partnership, but typically differs in that there is generally no intention of a continuing relationship beyond the original purpose. A joint venture may not involve the creation of a new legal entity. Whether a quasi-corporation is identified for the joint venture depends on the arrangements of the parties and legal requirements. The joint venture is a quasi-corporation if it meets the requirements for an institutional unit, particularly by having its own records. Otherwise, if each of the operations is effectively undertaken by the partners individually, then the joint venture is not an institutional unit and the operations would be seen as being undertaken by the individual partners to the joint venture. Because of the ambiguous status of joint ventures, there is a risk that they could be omitted or double-counted, so particular attention needs to be paid to them. <br />[OECD/Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment/Glossary/2008]</p><p>A joint venture is an association of firms or individuals formed to undertake a specific business project.

The NCP gathers information on national experiences with the Guidelines, handles enquiries, discusses matters related to the Guidelines and assists in solving problems that may arise in this connection. When issues arise concerning implementation of the Guidelines in relation to specific instances of business conduct, the NCP is expected to help resolve them. Generally, issues are dealt with by the NCP in whose country the issue has arisen. Any person or organisation may approach a National Contact Point to enquire about a matter related to the Guidelines. Because of the central role it plays, the effectiveness of the NCP is a crucial factor in determining how influential the Guidelines are in each national context. While it is recognised that governments should be accorded flexibility in the way they organise NCPs, it is nevertheless expected that all NCPs should function in a visible, accessible, transparent and accountable manner. These four criteria should guide NCPs in carrying out their activities. They also assist the Investment Committee in discussing the conduct of NCPs. NCPs are therefore accountable not only to their national constituencies, but to their peers and the Committee as well. The 2000 review enhanced this accountability by calling for annual reports of NCP activity, which serve as a basis for exchanges of view on the functioning of the NCPs among the adhering governments.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Trade gravity models can be used to predict a country’s degree of trade openness on the basis of the distance to and size of all its potential trading partners – that is, every other country in the world. The term “gravity” refers to the use of a form of the famous Newtonian gravity equation in assessing the potential trade “pull” from the constellation of potential trading partners. The GDP mass of each potential trading partner is divided by the square of its geographical distance from the country in question. In the case of Switzerland, the trade gravity index should be high because of the close proximity of large EU trading partners. A country like Australia, on the other hand, would have a low trade gravity index because the only geographically close potential trading partner is New Zealand, which is relatively small in GDP terms. These models also take account of the size of the domestic market by including terms for population or GDP, and measures of free trade agreements, population density, landlocked countries, contiguity, common language and colonial ties.</p></div>

  <h3 class="term-name">legal entity</h3>
<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>There are two main types of units in the real world that may qualify as institutional units, namely persons or groups of persons in the form of households, and legal or social entities. A household is a group of persons who share the same living accommodation, who pool some, or all, of their income and wealth and who consume certain types of goods and services collectively, mainly housing and food. As well as individual households, there are units described as institutional households that comprise groups of persons staying in hospitals, retirement homes, convents, prisons, etc. for long periods of time. A legal or social entity is one whose existence is recognized by law or society independently of the persons, or other entities, that may own or control it. This second type of institutional unit is one that engages in economic activities and transactions in its own right, such as a corporation, non-profit institution (NPI) or government unit. Such units are responsible and accountable for the economic decisions or actions they take, although their autonomy may be constrained to some extent by other institutional units for example, corporations are ultimately controlled by their shareholders. Some unincorporated enterprises belonging to households or government units may behave in much the same way as corporations, and such enterprises are treated as quasi-corporations when they have complete sets of accounts. In the legal sense, corporations may be described by different names: corporations, incorporated enterprises, public limited companies, public corporations, private companies, joint-stock companies, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, and so on. Conversely, some legal entities that are non-profit institutions may sometimes be described as “corporations”. The status of an institutional unit cannot always be inferred from its name, and it is necessary to examine its objectives and functions. In the SNA, the term corporation covers legally constituted corporations and also cooperatives, limited liability partnerships, notional resident units and quasi-corporations. (SNA) </div>

The objective of the statute for a European company is to create a European company with its own legislative framework. This allows companies incorporated in different economies to merge or to form a holding company or joint subsidiary, while avoiding the legal and practical constraints arising from the existence of different legal systems of the various Member States. A SE can be registered on the national register of the member state of the European Union in which it has its head office. The head office is the place where effective control and management or where central administration exists i.e. its true centre of operations and decisions. The registration has to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The registration can be easily transferred to another member state if the head office is moved to that member state. Where it occurs it is subject to legal provisions which require, inter alia, the drawing up of a transfer proposal, a report by the competent authority in the member state in which the SE is registered justifying the legal and economic aspects of the transfer, and the issuing of a certificate confirming compliance with the required formalities. SEs can be created by merger of national companies from different member states, by the creation of a joint venture between companies (or other entities) in different member states, by the creation of a SE subsidiary of a national company, or by the conversion of a national company into a SE.</p></div>

In its strict form this so-called Ricardian equivalence proposition implies that reductions in public saving resulting from tax cuts are offset one for one by increases in private saving leaving consumption, national saving and thus interest rates and investment unchanged. The same effect on national saving also holds for deficit financed permanent spending increases as private agents cut their consumption exactly by the level of the spending increase in expectation of future tax increases. While a consensus exists that the theoretical assumptions underlying this strong neutrality result are unlikely to hold in reality, Ricardian equivalence might still serve as a first approximation.  </p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>A decline in the terms of trade means that fewer goods can be imported with the same volume of export goods. That is, the purchasing power of domestic income decreases, or put another way it reduces the volume of imports that can be bought for a given volume of exports. Traditional GDP accounting does not take this into account. To approximate effects from terms of trade changes on the purchasing power of domestic income, nominal exports can be deflated using an import price deflator. This creates an indicator called command GDP, which is in essence a measure of an economy’s overall consumption potential.</p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Frequent recourse to large one-off operations </div>
<div class="term-source">mesures ponctuelles] in a number of OECD countries has undermined the accuracy of cyclically adjusted fiscal balances [soldes budgétaires corrigés des variations cycliques] as a measure of both the sustainability of public finance and the fiscal stance. This paper first provides detailed information on the nature and amount of these one-offs for 9 OECD countries. The paper then presents a new indicator – the “underlying” fiscal balance [solde budgétaire sous-jacent] – which effectively eliminates the impact of one-offs and cyclical developments. One-offs are derived as the deviations from trend in net capital transfers, i.e. from widely available national account data. This approach provides a consistent treatment of one-offs both across countries and over time, avoiding the potential information biases which could result from an individual identification of one-offs.</p><p>[OECD Economics Department Working Papers, No. 642, ECO/WKP(2008)50</div>

The OECD Model Tax Convention does not often deal with economic double taxation, but Article 9 seeks to address aspects of this sort of double taxation of related entities. As noted by the Commentary on Article 10, at paragraph 40 certain States' domestic tax laws and treaty practice seek to avoid or mitigate economic double taxation caused by the simultaneous taxation of the company's profits at the level of the company and of the dividends at the level of the shareholder.

An analogy can be drawn with the gap between actual and potential output growth, with stall speed growth corresponding to a period of below-trend positive output growth. A variant of the stall speed concept is that, at a certain prolonged period of low output growth, it is more likely that low growth will be followed by a recession rather than an acceleration in output growth. Self-fulfilling forces such as rising unemployment and declining confidence generate further weakness in activity via higher household saving rates and cutbacks in private investment, and the economy becomes more vulnerable to negative shocks.</span></p><p><span>[OECD/Economic Outlook, Nr. 92/11-2012]</span></div>

New sources of growth are necessary to put economies on a strong, inclusive and sustainable growth path to support the wellbeing of populations. The need to upgrade the regulatory capacities of governments and to restore confidence in markets, governments and institutions, further adds to the policy challenges. </p><p>NAEC seeks to address these and other issues in a horizontal approach to lay the groundwork for inclusive and sustainable growth. In doing so, it draws upon the value added expertise of the OECD, data and policy recommendations, as well as the accumulated experience of its Member and Partner countries in various interconnected policy areas   </p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Some policy areas have traditionally been politically more difficult to reform than others. Thus, the extent to which countries have followed up on priorities may be shaped by their nature. For instance, a country with recommendations in the areas of innovation and infrastructure might be expected to be more responsive than another country with similar appetite for reform but with priorities in the areas of job protection and wage formation, where political economy obstacles to reform are stronger. In order to account for this possibility an “adjusted” responsiveness rate has also been computed. This weighs responsiveness on each individual priority according to the difficulty of undertaking the relevant reform. The difficulty is measured by the inverse of average responsiveness to priorities in this area in non-crisis circumstances across the OECD or the BRIICS. <br></div>

The Indian multinational Tata is now the second most active investor in sub-Saharan Africa. Over 40% of the world’s researchers are now in Asia. As of 2008, developing countries were holding USD 4.2 trillion in foreign currency reserves, more than one and a half times the amount held by rich countries. These are just a few examples of a 20-year structural transformation of the global economy in which the world’s economic centre of gravity has moved towards the East and South, from OECD members to emerging economies, a phenomenon this report calls “shifting wealth”.</p><p>In economics and accounting terms, wealth has a very specific meaning. It is the net worth of a nation, household or person: the stock value of all assets owned minus liabilities owed at a particular point in time. Adam Smith, in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations, described wealth as “the annual produce of the land and labour of the society”, using a flow, not a stock concept. This report follows Smith’s lead and looks at shifting wealth mainly as a flow. Arguably, stock values are of equal importance to shifting wealth, but due to difficulties measuring a nation’s physical, human and natural capital stock, this report refers solely to stock values that can easily be identified such as foreign reserves, sovereign wealth fund assets and the increased size of the global labour force.</p><p>[<span>OECD/Perspectives on Global Development 2010: Shifting Wealth/OECD Publishing/2010]</span></div>

  <h3 class="term-name">indicators of potential financial vulnerabilities</h3>
<div class="term-source">This annex] presents indicators typically associated with financial vulnerabilities […] arising primarily from the domestic economy in four broad categories: the real economy, the non-financial sector, the financial sector and public finances. Possible weaknesses in the real economy are captured by the difference between the potential and the actual GDP growth rate, the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment (or NAIRU), the current account deficit and the evolution of relative unit labour costs. Indicators of financial market excesses related to the non-financial sector are debt of households and non-financial corporations and real house price growth. Core Tier-1 capital additions required to reach 5% (without any normative implications) of total assets in each of the country's selected banks, non-performing loans, and financial corporations' debt are included to account for the direct risk exposure of the financial sector. The calculations of the Core Tier-1 capital additions are based on over 1200 commercial banks, including 915 in the United States, 197 in the OECD euro area countries, 23 in the United Kingdom, 11 in Canada and 7 in Japan. Vulnerabilities stemming from the public sector are quantified along three dimensions: government net borrowing, gross government debt and the difference between 10year sovereign bond yields in real terms and the potential real GDP growth rate. Higher values indicate a larger vulnerability. <br>[ECO/CPE(2014)4/ANN1</div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Exogenous shocks to headline inflation, such as the recent food price shock in Russia, pose a challenge for monetary policy. Between 2006 and mid-2008, and then again starting in 2010, surging international prices for food and energy pushed up headline inflation in both emerging markets and advanced countries. Indirect tax increases implemented as part of fiscal consolidation have recently had a significant impact on headline inflation in many OECD economies, including inflation targeters, most clearly in the United Kingdom. Many central banks around the world chose to not to tighten their policies and instead have allowed headline inflation to be outside the target band for some time, in an expectation that the effect of these temporary factors will wane. For inflation targeters, such an approach has been referred to in the literature as "flexible" inflation targeting. <br></div>

First, traditional mission-oriented centres (MOCs) are owned and sometimes run by government departments or ministries at the national and sub-national levels; their role is to undertake research in specific topics or sectors in order to provide knowledge and technological capabilities to support policy-making. Second, public research centres and councils (PRCs) perform (and in some cases fund) basic and applied research in several fields; these overarching institutions tend to be of considerable size in several countries representing a significant share of the national R&amp;D capabilities. Third, Research Technology Organisations (RTOs), also known as industrial research institutes, are mainly dedicated to the development and transfer of science and technology to the private sector and society; although some of them are owned by government, in general, the administrative links of RTOs with governments tend to be looser than the rest. RTOs, often in the semi public sphere and in the non profit sector.Finally, a fourth group of publicly supported research institutes of diverse size, labelled as Independent Research Institutes (IRIs) perform both basic and applied research focused on “issues” or “problems” rather than just fields.

The issuance of longevity bonds is still in its early stage internationally, though it has the potential to encourage the development of annuities markets, where the re-insurance industry will play an important role. </p><p>[OECD/Economic Surveys: New Zealand/2007]</p><p> </div>

Another source of uncertainty is that many countries have a large lone-parent or non-categorical social assistance benefit (such as the RMI in France and AFDC/TANF in the United States) which is conditional on availability for work for some recipients but not others, and thus is partly an "unemployment" and partly a "non-employment" benefit.

A tax or benefit that is distributed in proportion to pre-tax (or pre-benefit) income has zero progressivity and no redistributive effect whatever the size of the tax or benefit. The Kakwani indicator ranges from plus 1 (maximum progressivity) to minus 2 (maximum regressivity). Note that, in the case of benefits, there is an important difference between a technically correct use of these terms, and frequently used language that refer to inequality-reducing transfers as “progressive”. In a technical sense, benefits are normally regressive as social transfers tend to decline at higher income levels. For a given size of the redistribution instrument, the more regressive a benefit, and the more progressive a tax, the bigger is its equalising effect. </div>

More specifically, the audit is conducted in order to: 1) ensure appropriate accounting and, if necessary, to request corrections of inappropriate accounting and to further institutional changes to prevent any recurrence; 2) confirm the accuracy of the settlement numbers and validity of the accounts. The scope of audit includes government institutions and local governments, with financial assistance from the central government, in addition to ministries and agencies.

The former OECD specification can be characterised as a traditional ‘backward-looking' Phillips curve, where current inflation is partly explained by an autoregressive distributed lag process of past inflation representing both inertia and inflation expectations formed on the basis of recent inflation outcomes. Conversely, the new approach adjusts this specification to incorporate the notion that inflation expectations are anchored around the central bank's inflation objective. </p></div>

<div class="term-expert-definition"><p>Product market reforms that enhance competition in formerly protected sectors usually lead to incumbents to engage in restructuring as they seek efficiency gains to preserve mark-ups in the face of downward pressures on prices. In turn, this leads to the displacement of workers and capital in the short run (Blanchard, 2006). Stronger competition also leads to the exit of least productive firms. In normal economic conditions, displaced resources are absorbed eventually by new entrants, more competitive firms that are expanding production or by other sectors. As a result of more efficient resource allocation, aggregate productivity increases and as lower prices stimulate demand employment is also expected to increase. However, when the economy is in a slump, demand may respond less to the lower prices resulting from competition. In such context, displaced resources are expected to remain unemployed for longer as a bleaker profit outlook and credit constraints slows the entry of new firms or the expansion of incumbent firms… </div>

The comparability of elderly population data is affected by differences, both within and across countries, in how regions and the geography of rural and urban communities, are defined. Elderly people tend to be concentrated in few areas within each country, which means that a small number of regions will have to face a number of specific social and economic challenges due to population ageing. These demographic trends have a number of implications for government and private spending on pensions, health care, and education and, more generally, for economic growth and welfare. This indicator is measured as a percentage of population. <br />[OECD/Data Portal/2015]

<div class="term-expert-definition">Firms can finance operations through debt or equity. The debt-to-equity ratio is a measure of a firm’s financial leverage, or degree to which companies finance their activities out of equity. It is calculated by dividing the debt of financial corporations by the total amount of shares and other equity liabilities of the same sector. Debt is defined as a specific subset of liabilities. All debt instruments are liabilities, but some liabilities such as shares, equity and financial derivatives are not debt. Debt is usually obtained as the sum of the following liability categories: currency and deposits, debt securities), loans, Insurance, pension and standardised guarantee programmes and other accounts payable. On the denominator side, shares and other equity correspond to a part of the own resources of financial corporations which are, by convention, reported as liabilities of the companies. Own funds, which are calculated as total net worth plus shares and other equity, would have been preferable as a denominator to avoid stock market fluctuations. However, due to the non-availability of data on non-financial assets for many OECD countries, the total net worth could not be calculated. In this respect, shares and other equity, which form a part of own funds, are selected as a denominator. The financial corporation sector (S12 in the System of National Accounts terminology) includes all private and public entities engaged in financial activities, such as monetary institutions (including the central bank), financial intermediaries, insurance companies and pension funds. If the ratio is 2.5 it means that the outstanding debt is 2.5 larger than their equity.

<div class="term-expert-definition">Real household net disposable income is defined as the sum of household final consumption expenditure and savings, minus the change in net equity of households in pension funds. This indicator also corresponds to the sum of wages and salaries, mixed income, net property income, net current transfers and social benefits other than social transfers in kind, less taxes on income and wealth and social security contributions paid by employees, the self-employed and the unemployed. Household gross adjusted disposable income additionally reallocates "income" from government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) to households to reflect social transfers in kind. These transfers reflect expenditures made by government or NPISHs on individual goods and services, such as health and education, on behalf of an individual household. The indicator includes the disposable income of non-profit institutions serving households. Disposable income, as a concept, is closer to the idea of income as generally understood in economics, than is either national income or gross domestic product (GDP). This indicator is measured in terms of net in annual growth rates and in terms of gross adjusted in USD per capita at current prices and PPPs.

<div class="term-expert-definition">Household spending is the amount of final consumption expenditure made by resident households to meet their everyday needs, such as: food, clothing, housing (rent), energy, transport, durable goods (notably, cars), health costs, leisure, and miscellaneous services. It is typically around 60% of gross domestic product (GDP) and is therefore an essential variable for economic analysis of demand. Household spending, including government transfers, is the actual individual consumption that it is equal to households' consumption expenditure plus those (individual) expenditures of general government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) that directly benefit households, such as, health care and education. "Housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels" is one out of the twelve categories included as part of individual consumption expenditures. Housing and energy expenditures consist of actual rentals for housing, imputed rentals for owner-occupied housing, housing maintenance and repairs, as well as costs for water, electricity, gas and other fuels.
