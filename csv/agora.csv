We work with governments to understand what drives economic, social and environmental change. We measure productivity and global flows of trade and investment. We analyse and compare data to predict future trends. We set international standards on a wide range of things, from agriculture and tax to the safety of chemicals. We look, too, at issues that directly affect the lives of ordinary people, like how much they pay in taxes and social security, and how much leisure time they can take. We compare how different countries’ school systems are readying their young people for modern life, and how different countries’ pension systems will look after their citizens in old age. Drawing on facts and real-life experience, we recommend policies designed to make the lives of ordinary people better. We work with business, through the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, and with labour, through the Trade Union Advisory Committee. We have active contacts as well with other civil society organisations. The common thread of our work is a shared commitment to market economies backed by democratic institutions and focused on the wellbeing of all citizens.

An aggregate is defined as the sum of its components. Additivity requires this identity to be preserved when the values of both an aggregate and its components in some reference period are extrapolated over time using a set of volume index numbers. Although desirable from an accounting viewpoint, additivity is actually a very restrictive property. As already noted, Laspeyres volume indices are additive because extrapolating the base period values by Laspeyres volume indices is equivalent to revaluing quantities in later periods by the same set of base period prices. Additivity implies that, at each level of aggregation, the volume index for an aggregate takes the form of a weighted arithmetic average of the volume indices for its components that uses their base period values as weights. This requirement virtually defines the Laspeyres index. Other volume indices in common use are therefore not additive.</p><p>[SNA-SCN/§16.55/1993]</p>",

In order to achieve this, it is necessary to add back pension contributions to, and subtract pension receipts from, the disposable income, or adjusted disposable income, of households recorded in the secondary distribution of income accounts in order to get back to a figure for the saving of households that is the same as what it would have been if pension contributions and pension receipts had not been recorded as current transfers in the secondary distribution of income account. The necessary adjustment item is therefore equal to: the total value of the actual social contributions payable into private funded pension schemes plus the total value of contribution supplements payable out of the property income attributed to insurance policy holders (i.e., holders of pension rights) minus the value of the associated service charges minus the total value of the pensions paid out as social insurance benefits by private funded pension schemes. This adjustment item is equal to the change in the net equity of households in pension funds described in paragraphs 11.93 to 11.96 of chapter XI. It must be added to the disposable income, or adjusted disposable income, of households before calculating saving in order to reconcile the saving of households with the change in their net equity in life insurance reserves and pension funds recorded in the financial account of the System. Opposite adjustments are, of course, needed in the use of income accounts of the insurance enterprises, autonomous pension funds or employers maintaining non-autonomous pension funds.

An “effective voice in the management”, as evidenced by an ownership of at least 10 per cent, implies that the direct investor is able to influence, or participate in, the management of an enterprise absolute control by the foreign investor is not required.Direct investment enterprises comprise:subsidiaries (an enterprise in which a non-resident investor owns more than 50 per cent) associates (an enterprise in which a non-resident investor owns between 10 and 50 per cent) and branches (unincorporated enterprises wholly or jointly owned by a non-resident investor) that are either directly or indirectly owned by the direct investor.When the 10 per cent ownership requirement for establishing a direct investment link with an enterprise is met, certain other enterprises that are related to the first enterprise are also regarded as direct investment enterprises. Hence the definition of direct investment enterprise extends to the branches and subsidiaries of subsidiaries of the direct investor (so-called “indirectly owned direct investment enterprises”).

In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period. Two main methods are adopted in practice. The first, referred to as &ldquo;quantity revaluation&rdquo;, is based on a methodology consistent with the above theory (i.e., by multiplying the current period quantity by the base period price). The second, commonly referred to as &ldquo;price deflation&rdquo;, involves dividing price indexes into the observed values to obtain the volume estimate.

See also technical note by the OECD Statistics Directorate on the OECD web site. For a description of the data used in individual countries see note to Annex Table 1 . National accounts provide a comprehensive accounting framework within which economic data can be compiled and presented in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policy-making. The accounts themselves present in a condensed way a great mass of detailed information, organized according to economic principles and perceptions, about the working of an economy. They provide a comprehensive and detailed record of the complex economic activities taking place within an economy and of the interaction between the different economic agents, and groups of agents, that takes place on markets or elsewhere. In practice the accounts are compiled for a succession of time periods, thus providing a continuing flow of information that is indispensable for the monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the performance of an economy over time. The accounts provides information not only about economic activities, but also about the levels of an economy's productive assets and the wealth of its inhabitants at particular points of time. Finally, they also include an external account that displays the links between an economy and the rest of the world. The accounts may be implemented at different levels of aggregation: at the level of individual economic agents, or institutional units for groups of such units, or institutional sectors or at the level of the total economy. In order to understand the workings of the economy, it is essential to be able to observe and analyse the economic interactions taking place between the different sectors of the economy. Certain key aggregate statistics, such as gross domestic product (GDP), that are widely used as indicators of economic activity at the level of the total economy, are defined within the System, but the calculation of such aggregates has long ceased to be the primary purpose for compiling the accounts. For an explanation of how GDP is constructed see note to Annex Table 2. The System is built around a sequence of interconnected flow accounts linked to different types of economic activity taking place within a given period of time, together with balance sheets that record the values of the stocks of assets and liabilities held by institutional units or sectors at the beginning and end of the period. Each flow account relates to a particular kind of activity such as production, or the generation, distribution, redistribution or use of income. Each account is balanced by introducing a balancing item defined residually as the difference between the total resources and uses recorded on the two sides of the account. The balancing item from one account is carried forward as the first item in the following account, thereby making the sequence of accounts an articulated whole. The balancing items typically encapsulate the net result of the activities covered by the accounts in question and are therefore economic constructs of considerable interest and analytical significance - for example, value added, disposable income and saving. There is also a strong link between the flow accounts and the balance sheets, as all the changes occurring over time that affect the assets or liabilities held by institutional units or sectors are systematically recorded in one or another of the flow accounts. The closing balance sheet is fully determined by the opening balance sheet and the transactions or other flows recorded in the sequence of accounts.</p><p>[OECD/Economics Department/Economics Glossary/2005]</p>",

Chemicals dumped by an industrial plant into a lake may kill fish and plant life and affect the livelihood of fishermen and farmers nearby. In contrast, a positive externality or external economy may arise from the construction of a road which opens a new area for housing, commercial development, tourism, etc. The invention of the transistor generated numerous positive externalities in the manufacture of modern telecommunication, stereo and computer equipment.

As a consequence, there are breaks in many national series. Moreover, a growing number of countries are using chain-weighted price indices to calculate real GDP and expenditures components. The figures on individual demand components follow, in general, the SNA definitions. One important deviation from the Standardised System is the line ""public investment"" which includes, whenever possible, fixed capital formation by both general government and government-owned and controlled enterprises. The definition and coverage of the latter may vary between countries. Private consumption expenditure: Final consumption expenditure of households and private non-profit institutions serving households. Gross fixed capital formation: The outlays (purchases and own-account production) of industries, producers of government services and producers of private non-profit services to households, on additions of new durable goods (commodities) to their stocks of fixed assets less their net sales of similar second-hand and scrapped goods. Excluded are the outlays of government services on durable goods for military use. Included are acquisitions of reproducible and non-reproducible durable goods, except land, mineral deposits, timber tracts and the like, for civilian use work-in-progress on construction projects capital repairs outlays on the improvement of land and on the development and extension of timber tracts, plantations, vineyards, etc. which take considerably more than a year to become productive, until they become productive the acquisition of breeding stock, draught animals, dairy cattle and the like and the transfer costs in connection with purchases and sales of land, mineral deposits, timber tracts, etc. Some countries, United States, Canada and France use hedonic price indices to deflate current-price values of investment in certain information and communication technology products such as computers.

The first is that the basis of calculating GDP is consistent for the countries under comparison. The second is that the unit in which GDP is expressed, the numeraire, is comparable. The simplest way of comparing the GDP of two different countries is to convert each amount (or, even better, the amount per capita) to a common currency using official exchange rates. However, this is widely recognised as being inadequate because market exchange rates do not adequately reflect the comparative purchasing power of local currencies in their own markets. The concept of the purchasing power parity (PPP) was developed to provide an alternative conversion factor for GDP, so that internationally comparable price and volume comparisons of GDP could be established. PPPs are the rates of currency conversion which equalise the purchasing power of different currencies. This means that a given sum of money, when converted into different currencies at the PPP rates, will buy the same basket of goods and services in all countries. In other words, PPPs are the rates of currency conversion which eliminate the differences in price levels between countries. Thus, when expenditures on GDP for different countries are converted into a common currency by means of PPPs, they are expressed, in effect, at the same set of international prices so that comparisons between countries reflect only differences in the volume of goods and services purchased. Expenditures converted to a common currency using exchange rates, on the other hand, reflect not only differences in the volumes purchased in the different countries, but also the differences in price levels between the countries. Exchange rates do not reflect the relative purchasing powers of different currencies and are not, therefore, the appropriate currency conversion rates with which to make international comparisons of volume. Expenditures on GDP converted at exchange rates remain essentially nominal measures the same expenditures converted using PPPs are real measures. The PPPs produced by the OECD do not refer solely to domestically-produced tradable goods and services valued at export prices. Instead, they have been calculated specifically for statistical purposes in order to enable international price and volume comparisons to be made for expenditure on GDP and its components. As such, they refer to the entire range of final goods and services which make up GDP as a whole including many items, such as construction and government services, which are not traded. Moreover, they are valued at domestic market prices and are calculated using expenditure weights that primarily reflect domestic demand. Both real and nominal expenditures are presented in OECD publications. The real values are expressed at international prices in US dollars the nominal values are expressed at national prices in both US dollars and national currency (the choice of the US dollar as the common unit of currency is purely a matter of convention which has no effect on the relative positions of countries.)</p><p>[OECD/Economics Department/Economics Glossary/2005]</p><p>Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalise the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries.

In most countries working day adjustment and trading day adjustment are used as synonyms. Context: The number of working or trading days in a given month or quarter can vary significantly for each statistical domain (e.g. production, merchandise trade) because of differing institutional arrangements, trade specific holidays, etc.). Some countries also include bridging effects in working day adjustments. These result from people taking holidays, for example, on Mondays and Fridays when an official public holiday occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays respectively. The type of working / trading day adjustment carried out needs to be tailored to the cultural and institutional environment operating within individual countries. In the United States, for example, working day adjustment classifies the days of the week into workdays (Monday through to Friday) and non-workdays (Sat. and Sun.) and thus the seasonal adjustment estimates two factors – workday and non-workday. Trading day adjustment (as performed in the US at least) allows for a different effect for each day of the week and computes seven factors – a Monday factor, a Tuesday factor and so on. Essentially, trading day adjustment is a more fine tuned seasonal adjustment method to account for calendar variation. In other countries there may be very distinct differences between workdays and non-workdays in the amount of business conducted, but not so much difference between Mondays, Tuesdays, through the Fridays. The US on the other hand, has distinctly different patterns of activity each day of the week and methods used in that country try to account for that difference.

The units operate in the same way as other units except that a legal arrangement between the parties establishes joint control over the unit. As an institutional unit, the joint venture may enter into contracts in its own name and raise finance for its own purposes. If R&amp;D joint ventures are stand-alone units, they should also be classified on the basis of the units they predominantly serve, taking whenever possible into account the established practice of the system of national accounts.<br />[OECD/Frascati Manual/2015]<br /><br />A joint venture is an association of firms or individuals formed to undertake a specific business project. It is similar to a partnership, but limited to a specific project (such as producing a specific product or doing research in a specific area. Joint ventures are now becoming more prevalent in the development of new technologies. (OECD/Glossary of Industrial Organisation, Economics &amp; Competition/1993) A joint venture is a contractual agreement between two or more parties for the purpose of executing a business undertaking in which the parties agree to share in the profits and losses of the enterprise as well as the capital formation and contribution of operating inputs or costs. It is similar to a partnership, but typically differs in that there is generally no intention of a continuing relationship beyond the original purpose. A joint venture may not involve the creation of a new legal entity. Whether a quasi-corporation is identified for the joint venture depends on the arrangements of the parties and legal requirements. The joint venture is a quasi-corporation if it meets the requirements for an institutional unit, particularly by having its own records. Otherwise, if each of the operations is effectively undertaken by the partners individually, then the joint venture is not an institutional unit and the operations would be seen as being undertaken by the individual partners to the joint venture. Because of the ambiguous status of joint ventures, there is a risk that they could be omitted or double-counted, so particular attention needs to be paid to them. <br />[OECD/Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment/Glossary/2008]</p><p>A joint venture is an association of firms or individuals formed to undertake a specific business project.

When issues arise concerning implementation of the Guidelines in relation to specific instances of business conduct, the NCP is expected to help resolve them. Generally, issues are dealt with by the NCP in whose country the issue has arisen. Any person or organisation may approach a National Contact Point to enquire about a matter related to the Guidelines. Because of the central role it plays, the effectiveness of the NCP is a crucial factor in determining how influential the Guidelines are in each national context. While it is recognised that governments should be accorded flexibility in the way they organise NCPs, it is nevertheless expected that all NCPs should function in a visible, accessible, transparent and accountable manner. These four criteria should guide NCPs in carrying out their activities. They also assist the Investment Committee in discussing the conduct of NCPs. NCPs are therefore accountable not only to their national constituencies, but to their peers and the Committee as well.

The GDP mass of each potential trading partner is divided by the square of its geographical distance from the country in question. In the case of Switzerland, the trade gravity index should be high because of the close proximity of large EU trading partners. A country like Australia, on the other hand, would have a low trade gravity index because the only geographically close potential trading partner is New Zealand, which is relatively small in GDP terms.

A household is a group of persons who share the same living accommodation, who pool some, or all, of their income and wealth and who consume certain types of goods and services collectively, mainly housing and food. As well as individual households, there are units described as institutional households that comprise groups of persons staying in hospitals, retirement homes, convents, prisons, etc. for long periods of time. A legal or social entity is one whose existence is recognized by law or society independently of the persons, or other entities, that may own or control it. This second type of institutional unit is one that engages in economic activities and transactions in its own right, such as a corporation, non-profit institution (NPI) or government unit. Such units are responsible and accountable for the economic decisions or actions they take, although their autonomy may be constrained to some extent by other institutional units for example, corporations are ultimately controlled by their shareholders. Some unincorporated enterprises belonging to households or government units may behave in much the same way as corporations, and such enterprises are treated as quasi-corporations when they have complete sets of accounts. In the legal sense, corporations may be described by different names: corporations, incorporated enterprises, public limited companies, public corporations, private companies, joint-stock companies, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, and so on. Conversely, some legal entities that are non-profit institutions may sometimes be described as “corporations”. The status of an institutional unit cannot always be inferred from its name, and it is necessary to examine its objectives and functions. In the SNA, the term corporation covers legally constituted corporations and also cooperatives, limited liability partnerships, notional resident units and quasi-corporations.

A SE can be registered on the national register of the member state of the European Union in which it has its head office. The head office is the place where effective control and management or where central administration exists i.e. its true centre of operations and decisions. The registration has to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The registration can be easily transferred to another member state if the head office is moved to that member state. Where it occurs it is subject to legal provisions which require, inter alia, the drawing up of a transfer proposal, a report by the competent authority in the member state in which the SE is registered justifying the legal and economic aspects of the transfer, and the issuing of a certificate confirming compliance with the required formalities.

The same effect on national saving also holds for deficit financed permanent spending increases as private agents cut their consumption exactly by the level of the spending increase in expectation of future tax increases.

New sources of growth are necessary to put economies on a strong, inclusive and sustainable growth path to support the wellbeing of populations. The need to upgrade the regulatory capacities of governments and to restore confidence in markets, governments and institutions, further adds to the policy challenges. </p><p>NAEC seeks to address these and other issues in a horizontal approach to lay the groundwork for inclusive and sustainable growth. In doing so, it draws upon the value added expertise of the OECD, data and policy recommendations, as well as the accumulated experience of its Member and Partner countries in various interconnected policy areas   </p><p>[SG/NAEC(2013)1]</p>",

Adam Smith, in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations, described wealth as “the annual produce of the land and labour of the society”, using a flow, not a stock concept. This report follows Smith’s lead and looks at shifting wealth mainly as a flow. Arguably, stock values are of equal importance to shifting wealth, but due to difficulties measuring a nation’s physical, human and natural capital stock, this report refers solely to stock values that can easily be identified such as foreign reserves, sovereign wealth fund assets and the increased size of the global labour force.</p><p>[<span>OECD/Perspectives on Global Development 2010: Shifting Wealth/OECD Publishing/2010]</span></p>",

Possible weaknesses in the real economy are captured by the difference between the potential and the actual GDP growth rate, the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment (or NAIRU), the current account deficit and the evolution of relative unit labour costs. Indicators of financial market excesses related to the non-financial sector are debt of households and non-financial corporations and real house price growth. Core Tier-1 capital additions required to reach 5% (without any normative implications) of total assets in each of the country's selected banks, non-performing loans, and financial corporations' debt are included to account for the direct risk exposure of the financial sector. The calculations of the Core Tier-1 capital additions are based on over 1200 commercial banks, including 915 in the United States, 197 in the OECD euro area countries, 23 in the United Kingdom, 11 in Canada and 7 in Japan. Vulnerabilities stemming from the public sector are quantified along three dimensions: government net borrowing, gross government debt and the difference between 10year sovereign bond yields in real terms and the potential real GDP growth rate.

This is understood in broad terms as the level of governmental influence on their research activities and funding, rather than just mere ownership (Crow and Bozeman 1998). <br> We can distinguish between four ideal types. First, traditional mission-oriented centres (MOCs) are owned and sometimes run by government departments or ministries at the national and sub-national levels; their role is to undertake research in specific topics or sectors in order to provide knowledge and technological capabilities to support policy-making. Second, public research centres and councils (PRCs) perform (and in some cases fund) basic and applied research in several fields; these overarching institutions tend to be of considerable size in several countries representing a significant share of the national R&amp;D capabilities. Third, Research Technology Organisations (RTOs), also known as industrial research institutes, are mainly dedicated to the development and transfer of science and technology to the private sector and society; although some of them are owned by government, in general, the administrative links of RTOs with governments tend to be looser than the rest. RTOs, often in the semi public sphere and in the non profit sector.Finally, a fourth group of publicly supported research institutes of diverse size, labelled as Independent Research Institutes (IRIs) perform both basic and applied research focused on “issues” or “problems” rather than just fields. In many cases IRIs may be termed as “semi-public” as they are founded under different legal forms and work at the boundaries between public and private, but develop their activities with substantial public support and/or participation of public representatives in their governance.</p><p>[OECD/Actor brief on public research organisations -OECD Innovation Policy Platform/2011]</p>",

A common explanation for this change, examined in this paper, is that inflation expectations have become better anchored. While neither the explanation nor the empirical approach employed are novel, a contribution of the paper is that it applies two competing empirical specifications across all OECD economies, where competing specifications correspond to the ‘former' and ‘new' specification for deriving measures of the unemployment gap which underlie the OECD's Economic Outlook projections. The former OECD specification can be characterised as a traditional ‘backward-looking' Phillips curve, where current inflation is partly explained by an autoregressive distributed lag process of past inflation representing both inertia and inflation expectations formed on the basis of recent inflation outcomes. Conversely, the new approach adjusts this specification to incorporate the notion that inflation expectations are anchored around the central bank's inflation objective. </p><p>[OECD/Incorporating Anchored Inflation Expectations in the Phillips Curve and in the Derivation of OECD Measures of Equilibrium Unemployment/Economics Department Working Papers/2015]</p>",
