			</heading>
			<p id="ID-42-1094985" indent="n" numbering="n">While still disappointing, the global
				economy is moving forward, and it is doing so at multiple speeds. These multiple
				speeds reflect different paths towards self-sustained growth, with each path
				carrying its own mix of risks. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1094994" indent="y" numbering="n">In the United States, large imbalances
				had built up prior to the crisis and eventually erupted, but the economy has
				undergone significant adjustment, which is beginning to bear fruit. The combination
				of a repaired financial system and a revival in confidence is driving growth.
				Private sector demand is stabilising as household deleveraging is far advanced,
				house prices are rebounding and wealth accumulation is supporting consumption.
				Employment is growing, adding to confidence. Fiscal policy should reduce the effects
				of excessive tightening coming from across-the-board sequestration, by refocusing or
				limiting the cuts in the current year, while ensuring a credible medium-term
				consolidation path. Monetary policy should remain accommodative but vigilant, as
				declining benefits of further quantitative easing are likely at some point to be
				outweighed by increasing costs in terms of misallocation and excessive risk-taking. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1094999" indent="y" numbering="n">In Japan, imbalances had been building up
				long before the crisis, but a radically new policy is being implemented only now.
				High debt, weak potential growth and persistent deflation are being tackled by a
				policy mix which includes aggressive monetary policy and the promise of decisive
				fiscal consolidation, as well as the implementation of structural reforms. While the
				policy shift is welcome, it will take a delicate balancing act to boost growth in a
				more sustainable way, raise inflationary expectations to beat deflation and secure
				the sustainability of a huge public debt.</p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095004" indent="y" numbering="n">In the euro area, still-rising
				unemployment is the most pressing challenge for policy makers. Protracted weakness
				could evolve into stagnation with negative implications for the global economy. Such
				a perspective would resonate negatively with large persistent risks of adverse
				interactions between weakly capitalised banks, public debt financing requirements
				and exit risks. The more positive news is that in many euro area countries
				adjustment, both fiscal and structural, has been going on for several years.
				Government debt ratios should start to decline soon with positive implications for
				market risk assessments. And once debt ratios begin to decline, only modest
				additional fiscal tightening would be needed to bring them to safe levels over the
				medium term. The improvement in competitiveness in some countries also reflects
				structural efforts. However, reform fatigue is mounting as visible results in growth
				and jobs still fail to materialise, in part because reforms can take time to bring
				results but also due to the weak macroeconomic environment. Higher wages and product
				market liberalisation in surplus countries would provide a more symmetric and
				effective rebalancing, while supporting growth. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095009" indent="y" numbering="n">The macroeconomic policy stance in the
				euro area should be more supportive to avoid dissipating the benefits of adjustment.
				The ECB has appropriately lowered its policy rate and committed to maintain an
				accommodative stance for as long as needed, but more can be done through further
				non-conventional measures. In addition, progress on financial sector repair is
				needed to ensure that the impact of monetary policy is uniformly transmitted to the
				real economy. As weakness persists, the automatic stabilisers should be allowed to
				operate freely. Last but not least, the strengthening of euro area institutions, in
				particular banking union, must continue. As euro area policy has often been behind
				the curve, perceptions of strong disagreement among members states could have
				negative consequences on confidence and exacerbate fragmentation. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095014" indent="y" numbering="n">Outside the major developed economies,
				there is a large and heterogeneous group of <shortcitation>innocent
					bystanders</shortcitation>, some advanced and many emerging market economies,
				without large pre-crisis imbalances and with solid growth in the recovery, but where
				new imbalances, often resulting from spillovers from the policy stance in other
				regions, are emerging through inflationary pressures and high and rising asset
				prices. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095029" indent="y" numbering="n">What lessons can be drawn from such
				diverse performance across countries? To some extent, at least, different paths to
				sustainable growth reflect uneven progress in two dimensions: confidence-building
				and financial sector repair. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095034" indent="y" numbering="n">Confidence is essential for both
				companies and households to boost spending, especially on investment, which
				continues to remain below average in many advanced and some emerging countries. It
				is the duty of policy to rebuild confidence through credible medium-term frameworks
				involving all policy pillars: monetary, fiscal, financial, structural, and,
				especially in the case of the euro area, institutional. The policy mix should be
				balanced and based on multiple pillars, as relying only on a limited set of
				instruments could lead to renewed instability. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095039" indent="y" numbering="n">Financial sector repair is needed to
				ensure that confidence feeds into stronger activity. The difference in the paths to
				recovery reflects, importantly, the decisive action in this area in the United
				States relative to the long delay in Japan and in the euro area. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095044" indent="y" numbering="n">Fiscal policy will continue to be geared
				towards consolidation. Its composition should be adjusted to make it more
				growth-friendly and improve its impact on equity and income distribution. The pace
				of deficit reduction should be slower if weakness persists. In this respect, it may
				be worth recalling that, contrary to widespread perceptions, the pace of
				consolidation on the two sides of the Atlantic has been not so dissimilar.
				Differences in activity and employment performance are likely to reflect differences
				in labour market institutions and financial sector repair.</p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095049" indent="y" numbering="n">With limited fiscal space, monetary
				policy will continue to bear most responsibility for supporting activity, including
				through unconventional measures. The United States and now Japan have taken this
				route, less so the euro area. At the same time, protracted monetary easing may lead
				to excessive risk taking, bubbles and resource misallocation. Exit from
				unconventional monetary policy, when needed, may be difficult to manage and less
				smooth than desirable, possibly leading to sharp rises in bond yields and serious
				negative consequences for growth in a number of advanced and emerging economies. </p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095054" indent="y" numbering="n">In any case, restoring a more normal
				stance of monetary policy can hardly be achieved without a sustainable fiscal path.
				And debt sustainability cannot be obtained without sustained and sustainable growth
				which, in turn, requires strong efforts in structural reforms. From this point of
				view, Japan, among the large advanced economies has been lagging behind, less so the
				euro area. In the euro area, however, progress is still needed in addressing
				barriers in labour markets, and especially those facing the young generations.</p>
			<p id="ID-42-1095059" indent="y" numbering="n">Finally, in such a diverse, multiple-path
				environment, internal and external imbalances are more likely to increase than the
				opposite. Current account imbalances are still large and could be rising in the
				future, while unorthodox monetary policies are likely to generate shock waves both
				during their implementation and once they begin to be withdrawn. National policy
				frameworks will be less credible if they conflict with each other or disregard
				spillover effects. Adjusting the composition of national policy packages in a
				cooperative fashion to facilitate rebalancing and minimise adverse spillover effects
				is necessary. It is also possible. </p>

						global recovery over the past four years has been muted and uneven, with
						increasingly divergent cross-country activity developments among both
						advanced and emerging economies. Countries without large pre-crisis
						imbalances, notably the large emerging market economies and some
						English-speaking and Nordic economies, have had solid growth outcomes in the
						recovery period, although imbalances are now possibly emerging, with
						inflationary pressures and high asset prices in the general low-interest
						rate environment. Improving growth outcomes are also now appearing in those
						countries that had sizeable pre-crisis imbalances but have subsequently
						acted decisively to recapitalise banks and ease monetary policy
						aggressively, such as the United States. In contrast, countries that had
						built up large imbalances inside the euro area, with its incomplete
						institutional set-up and weak bank capitalisation, have been mired in
						recession against the background of imperfect monetary policy transmission,
						large fiscal consolidation needs and fears of break-up. In most of the OECD
						area, fiscal policy is not able to support growth and the burden of
						stabilisation has fallen on monetary policy with a number of accompanying
						strains and international spill-over effects.</p>

								consumption in final demand. In addition, the recent rapid rise in

								prices in some locations have led to additional measures being taken

								activity. In India, investment growth remained weak throughout 2012,

								acquisition and energy bottlenecks. New measures have been

								in a number of sectors and steps to improve the availability of
								finance for infrastructure projects. Investment growth has also
								recently been weak in Brazil, with infrastructure bottlenecks

								in 2014, helped by efforts to speed up the approval of large
								investment projects, the partial deregulation of foreign direct

								>The medium-term outlook for global current account imbalances

								That is the upshot of applying a simple econometric framework that
								explains current account balances in major surplus and deficit zones
								in terms of: the position in business and house price cycles
								relative to trading partners; structural fiscal balances relative to
								trading partners; real effective exchange rates; real oil prices;
								and global interest rates (see Ollivaud and Schwellnus,
								forthcoming). Based on this empirical framework a decomposition
								analysis suggests that divergent business and housing market cycles
								alone can explain about 40% of the post-crisis decline in global
								current account imbalances, as demand has contracted by more in
								deficit countries than surplus countries (see figure below). This in
								turn implies that, in the absence of policy adjustment, global
								imbalances would rebound as output returns to potential and housing
								markets normalise.</p>

							<p id="ID-42-1276333" indent="y" numbering="n">Although this baseline
								suggests that global current account imbalances would remain below
								the pre-crisis peak, policy actions supporting further current
								account narrowing would be warranted for a number of reasons.
								Firstly, current account deficits in the United States and the euro
								area deficit zone would fail to stabilise net foreign assets-to-GDP
								ratios. Secondly, there are a number of upside risks to such a
								baseline, including renewed housing market booms in deficit
								countries that could be set off by a rebound in capital flows. A
								variant scenario suggests that a return of residential investment
								rates to pre-crisis peaks could significantly raise global
								imbalances (scenario 2 in table and figure above). In the absence of
								further policy adjustment, historical experience suggests that there
								is an increased risk of disruptive adjustment in the form of sudden
								stops in capital inflows in current account deficit countries, which
								have frequently precipitated financial crises with large
								cross-border spillover effects.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1276338" indent="y" numbering="n">Ambitious fiscal
								adjustment in countries with larger remaining fiscal imbalances
								would bring current account balances closer to those consistent with
								stabilising net foreign assets. In a variant <emphasis emph="italic"
									>fiscal adjustment</emphasis><emphasis emph="italic">
									scenario</emphasis> (scenario 3) it is assumed that the United
								States, euro area deficit countries and Japan engage in fiscal
								adjustment (increase in the primary structural balance of 1% of GDP
								per year) over the period 2015-20 whereas there is no fiscal
								adjustment in China and the euro area surplus zone. Real effective
								exchange rates are assumed to depreciate in countries with larger
								fiscal adjustment or larger initial output gaps (10% in the euro
								area deficit countries, 5% in the United States), while they
								appreciate in China and the euro area surplus zone (both 5%), which
								allows current account narrowing to occur partially through the
								switch of expenditure between foreign and domestic demand. Relative
								to the baseline with minimal policy adjustment these assumptions
								imply a large decline in global imbalances over the period 2015-20,
								reducing the gap between the projected current account balance and
								that required to stabilise net foreign assets by around 40% for the
								United States and achieving broad stabilisation of net foreign
								assets in euro area deficit countries (see table above).</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1276351" indent="y" numbering="n">Structural reforms that
								raise GDP, employment and welfare could have the added advantage of
								enhancing external sustainability by narrowing current account
								imbalances. The scenario analysis assumes a package of selected
								structural reforms, with likely effects on current account balances
								based on previous OECD work (Kerdrain <emphasis emph="italic">et
									al.</emphasis>, 2010; Kennedy and Slok, 2005). In particular,
								labour market reforms in euro area deficit countries are assumed to
								improve competitiveness and reduce the current account deficit by
								around 1% of GDP while product market reforms – especially in
								sectors sheltered from trade – reduce surpluses in euro area surplus
								countries by around 1% of GDP. In the United States, tax reforms,
								including reductions in the favourable treatment of interest
								expenses, raise private saving by around 0.5% of GDP while in Japan
								product market reforms are assumed to raise private investment by
								0.5% of GDP. In China, financial liberalisation and the expansion of
								the social safety net reduce private saving by 1% of GDP.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1276360" indent="y" numbering="n">A combination of
								structural reforms and fiscal consolidation would be sufficient to
								put global imbalances on a gently declining path (scenario 4 in
								table and figure above). Moreover, it would provide some margin if
								upside risks to imbalances were to materialise.</p>

								>Japan faces a huge fiscal challenge because of its very high gross
								debt level – over 200% of GDP – and its large primary deficit –
								projected at over 9% of GDP in 2013. The challenge is amplified by
								years of sustained deflation, which aggressive monetary policy is
								now aiming to address, and poor growth prospects given continued
								demographic headwinds. The fiscal situation represents an important
								source of macroeconomic risk, not only for Japan, but also for other
								countries given their exposure to Japan’s financial institutions and
								Japan’s size in the world economy. Risks could materialise if
								domestic investors decided to diversify their portfolios away from
								Japanese government bonds, if declining private saving required
								sustained net foreign borrowing to finance fiscal deficits, or if
								domestic and foreign investors simply lost confidence in medium to
								long-term debt sustainability. The challenge for Japan is thus to
								retain the confidence of investors during the many years it will
								take to turn the debt dynamics around. A three-pillar medium-term
								strategy for doing so was announced by the new government in
								January. First, the new government remains committed to achieving
								primary balance by 2020. Second, there are to be structural reforms
								to raise Japan’s growth potential. And third, an inflation target of
								2% has been introduced as the objective for monetary policy. This
								Box reports on a number of model simulations illustrating the
								contribution that this plan could make to lowering Japan’s
								government debt burden.</p>

								>The impact of the first pillar in isolation is illustrated by a
								simulation that incorporates the objective of achieving primary
								balance by 2020 and subsequently adjusting the fiscal stance so as
								to stabilise the gross debt burden around today’s level.
								Accordingly, the recent re-orientation of monetary policy is not
								taken into account. Starting from the current deflationary
								environment and given the impact of fiscal consolidation on activity
								and prices, deflation remains prevalent until the early-2020s. Under
								these conditions, and assuming a fiscal multiplier of 0.5, 10
								percentage points of GDP in budget consolidation is needed between
								2013 and 2020 to reach a primary balance, and an additional one
								percentage point of GDP is needed over the following 10 years to
								keep the debt ratio stable. Because the debt burden stops rising
								around 2020, this scenario can be seen as the minimum that would
								need to occur to reassure investors.</p>

							<p id="ID-42-1278827" indent="y" numbering="n">The second part of the
								new government’s strategy consists of structural reforms to raise
								Japan’s growth potential. Although the details of this part of the
								plan will only be announced in June, it could include measures to
								raise the labour force participation rate (with most potential from
								a rise in female participation) as well as measures to raise
								aggregate productivity growth, such as reforming regulation of
								sheltered sectors. To simulate the impact of this second pillar, the
								participation rate is assumed to rise gradually by 2½ percentage
								points above baseline, and productivity growth is assumed to also
								rise gradually by 0.2 percentage point above baseline. Higher
								participation has a positive effect on the fiscal balance
								commensurate with the size of automatic stabilisers. On account of
								increased participation and productivity combined, the level of
								potential output is about 7% higher than in the baseline by 2035.
								The cumulative effects of faster potential growth on the debt burden
								amount to a reduction of over 20 percentage points of GDP in 2035
								relative to fiscal consolidation alone, and would continue to
								accumulate thereafter.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1278832" indent="y" numbering="n">The impact of the third
								pillar is illustrated by adding to the first two the increase in the
								inflation target to 2% and determined monetary policy efforts to
								reach it. As a result, inflation expectations gradually adjust
								upward and deflation ends rapidly. In the scenario, higher inflation
								causes market interest rates to rise and leads to higher nominal
								financing costs for the government, but the implicit average
								interest rate paid on all outstanding debt rises more slowly than
								inflation, reflecting the existing maturity structure of debt. This
								effect erodes the debt ratio, which by 2035 is about 15 percentage
								points of GDP lower than in the second scenario. The effect is
								modest, and front-loaded, because of the relatively short maturity
								structure of Japanese government debt: close to 40% of currently
								outstanding market debt is to be refinanced within 2 years. Higher
								inflation is assumed not to affect the primary budget balance on the
								assumption that it would raise primary revenue as much as spending,
								but the extent of <emphasis emph="italic">de facto</emphasis>
								indexation may well be higher on the spending side, and even if it
								is not the primary balance will tend to deteriorate given that
								spending is higher</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1280369" indent="n" numbering="n">than revenue. On the
								other hand, the scenario does not take into account that the
								monetary policy action to reach the inflation target is likely to
								reduce debt servicing costs, via two channels. First, quantitative
								easing via the JGB market may imply that interest rates rise less
								than inflation expectations due to portfolio rebalancing effects.
								Second, quantitative easing substitutes base money and low-earning
								reserves for higher-earning JGBs in the private sector’s portfolio,
								which is likely to reduce overall interest costs for the government
								sector (after taking into account remittances from the Bank of
								Japan). The net balance of these conflicting influences is not clear
								but it is certainly possible that public debt could fall more than
								in this scenario.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1278837" indent="y" numbering="n">An extreme version of the
								potential additional debt-reduction effects of the unconventional
								monetary policy actions necessary to substantially raise inflation
								are illustrated in a final scenario in which higher inflation does
								not pass through into higher nominal interest rates. In this
								scenario, not only can the government finance its deficits more
								cheaply in real terms as inflation increases without an increase in
								nominal interest rates, but in addition the resulting fall in real
								interest rates boosts activity. As a result, the debt burden falls
								much more rapidly than in the previous scenario where nominal
								interest rates adjusted to higher inflation. The extreme assumption
								underlying this scenario needs to be emphasised, however. To
								maintain nominal interest rates unchanged compared with scenario 3
								despite inflation having reached the 2% target, the Bank of Japan
								would have to engage in continuous quantitative easing which at some
								point would seem certain to generate destabilising effects on
								inflation and financial markets. Hence, scenario 4 could at most be
								followed for a limited period after which policy would have to
								revert to that underlying scenario 3. Such a limited period might
								nonetheless have a durable impact on debt levels compared with
								scenario 3.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1278842" indent="y" numbering="n">A final caveat concerns
								the size of the fiscal multiplier. The large amount of fiscal
								consolidation implicit in the government’s strategy has limited
								impacts on activity, employment and prices if the fiscal multiplier
								is low, as assumed so far. With a fiscal multiplier of one, which
								cannot be excluded in view of monetary policy being highly extended,
								these negative impacts would be non-negligible. In scenario 3, going
								from a 0.5 to a 1.0 fiscal multiplier lowers nominal GDP growth by
								an average of 1.6 percentage points between 2015 and 2020 when
								consolidation is most rapid, through both real activity and price
								effects, and by about 0.3 percentage point of GDP after 2020. If, in
								addition, hysteresis mechanisms were to be stronger than assumed,
								the negative impact of fiscal consolidation on the long-term
								productive capacity of the economy would also be non-negligible.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1278847" indent="y" numbering="n">The upshot of the
								analysis is that, if successful, the three-prong strategy would end
								the long rise in the public debt ratio and put it on a downward
								trend by the end of the current decade. On the other hand, according
								to the simulations, the debt burden would fall relatively slowly and
								may well remain close to 200% of GDP in 2035. Financing needs will
								remain large and Japan may thus remain vulnerable to crises of
								confidence.</p>

								<p id="IDd80184ef-d930-42c9-aa20-21a228000633" indent="y"
									numbering="n">Credit-related measures have been implemented in
									several countries in response to rapid mortgage and house price
									growth and high household debt, mainly by limiting loan-to-value
									(LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. Such measures have in
									some cases been applied to foreign currency-denominated
									mortgages (Poland and Hungary) to limit the vulnerability of
									non-hedged borrowers, especially households, to exchange rate
									volatility.</p>
								<p id="ID82aae0be-8551-41b7-ab46-8c9a5f74786e" indent="y"
									numbering="n">Liquidity-related measures have been adopted by

								<p id="ID-42-1280686" indent="y" numbering="n">Capital-related

									proposed, including countercyclical capital buffers, an
									internationally harmonised leverage ratio to contain the
									build-up of excessive leverage, and additional capital buffers
									for the most systemically important institutions (BIS, 2012).
									This category of measures includes bank dynamic provisioning
									which was implemented by Spain in 2000 to deal with a sharp
									increase in credit risk on banks’ balance sheets after a period
									of rapid credit growth in the late 1990s. With the aim of
									calming the property market, Switzerland has recently introduced
									a counter-cyclical buffer, amounting to 1% of risk-weighted

								<p id="ID-42-1280704" indent="y" numbering="n">Experience with
									macro-prudential policy is still limited, but some evidence on
									their beneficial effects has started to emerge. Regarding
										<emphasis emph="italic">credit-related measures,</emphasis>
									limits on DTI and LTV ratios are associated with lower credit
									growth (IMF, 2012) and higher LTV ratios are found to slow house
									prices inflation (Crowe <emphasis emph="italic">et
										al.</emphasis>, 2011; Igan and Kang, 2011, Wong <emphasis
										emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011; and IMF, 2012).
									Conditional on a housing bust, the presence of an LTV cap is
									found to limit the vulnerability of banking systems to mortgage
									default (Wong <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011).
									In line with these econometric results, DTI and LTV measures
									introduced by Korea are assessed to have reduced house price
									volatility, limited speculative incentives, and kept household
									default rates low, though they have not prevented a very sharp
									increase in household indebtedness. Similarly, the 2010 measures
									taken in China are seen to have contributed to a slowdown in
									bank lending growth and a house price decline between end-2011
									and mid-2012. House prices have, however, started to go up again
									since mid-2012, prompting the authorities to announce a stricter
									implementation of existing measures. On the other hand, even if
									they may have helped moderate house price increases, LTV and DPI
									caps in Canada, Norway and Sweden have not prevented property
									prices from reaching very high levels relative to income and
									rents.</p>
								<p id="ID-42-1280725" indent="y" numbering="n">The liquidity-related
									measure introduced by New Zealand also appears to have been
									effective although it led to a higher-than-anticipated increase
									in average funding costs (Lim <emphasis emph="italic">et
										al.</emphasis>, 2011; and IMF, 2012).</p>
								<p id="ID-42-1280734" indent="y" numbering="n">Regarding <emphasis
										emph="italic">capital-related measures</emphasis>, larger
									capital buffers are found to increase the resilience of the
									banking system by mitigating the effects of loan losses on loan
									growth in bad times (Nier and Zicchino, 2008). The bank dynamic
									provisioning in Spain helped cover rising credit losses during
									the financial crisis, although the coverage fell well short of
									what turned out to have been required. Moreover, it was not
									effective in curbing credit growth, which grew by 25% annually
									in the years preceding the crisis. In contrast, in Brazil
									increases in the capital requirements on consumer loans and
									reserve requirements helped to reduce the speed of household
									credit growth. As reserve requirements do not differentiate by
									asset classes, they are however found to be less effective in
									limiting house price appreciations than variations in capital
									requirements, which can be specifically targeted at housing
									credit (IMF, 2012).</p>
								<p id="ID-42-1280743" indent="y" numbering="n">The evidence
									discussed above suggests that targeted macro-prudential tools
									are effective in limiting undesirable developments.
									Nevertheless, there are limits to their effectiveness and
									capacity to reduce systemic risks and their implementation can
									be challenging. Given that macro-prudential policy is aimed at
									containing systemic risk, it has to be employed pre-emptively
									before system-wide threats develop. The application of a
									discretionary macro-prudential policy may, however, be resisted
									by interest groups, while choosing the right timing to introduce
									a measure can prove to be difficult. Moreover, calibrating
									various instruments so as to take into account their expected
									costs and benefits as well as interactions with other measures
									and policies is not straightforward. These considerations
									suggest that macro-prudential responsibility should lie with a
									single independent institution having control over suitable
									tools to attain its objectives, as recommended by the European
									Systemic Risk Board (ESRB, 2012).1</p>

						and the holdings of government bonds and exchange-traded funds in two years,
						and to more than double the average remaining maturity of the government
						bonds it purchases. This radical shift in policy is aimed at reaching the
						new 2% inflation target and the boldness of the approach will likely help
						shake up inflation expectations of households and businesses. The US Federal
						Reserve continues to purchase Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a
						rate of $85 billion per month (0.5% of GDP) and has stated that it will
						continue to do so until there is a significant improvement in labour market
						conditions. The ECB cut the main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 0.5%
						and the marginal lending rate by 50 basis points to 1% in May. In the United
						Kingdom, the policy stance has not been changed recently, and remains
						accommodative. The policy stance varies among largest emerging market
						economies: policy interest rates have been cut in India from relatively high
						levels; rates have been raised from historically low levels in Brazil; and
						in China liquidity withdrawals have been stepped up, though the policy

								medium-term inflation and disinflationary pressures in the context

								driving the overnight rate below zero. It could consider following
								up on its recent forward guidance on maintaining the accommodative
								policy stance, including the commitment to keep fixed rate full
								allotment financing operations for at least a year, by explicitly
								linking such guidance to inflation prospects. Expansion of asset
								purchases is desirable and different options for such interventions

								credit flows to such firms and ease bank balance-sheet pressures,

								way that is not overly susceptible to asymmetric information and
								moral hazard problems. Further purchases of covered bonds could be
								an option for quantitative easing, but the scope for this is
								limited, given the relatively small size of covered bond markets.
								For larger-scale quantitative easing, the ECB could consider buying
								government bonds of all euro area members on a non-discriminatory
								basis for monetary policy purposes. This would be distinct from
								activation of the country-specific OMT programme, which is based on
								conditionality and aimed at removing interest premia associated with
								redenomination risk. Nonetheless, having two parallel programmes
								potentially intervening in government debt markets – for different
								purposes, and with and without conditionality – would call for
								careful communication. In addition, the ECB could start buying
								corporate bonds and provide direct incentives to banks to extend
								credit, for instance by further relaxing collateral requirements or
								adopting programmes similar to the ones introduced in the United
								Kingdom and Japan. The potential activity effects of actions to ease
								transmission and lower bond yields in vulnerable countries may be
								stronger than those of actions that affect financial markets in the

					<p id="IDa98d12db-ddd0-4739-bec8-98f2551696a0" indent="y" numbering="n"> In the
						euro area, the area-wide fiscal consolidation (measured as an improvement in
						the underlying primary budget balance) of just over 4% of GDP between 2009
						and 2013 was similar to that in the United States over the same period. This
						casts doubts about the role of fiscal tightening in explaining the
						comparatively weak performance of the euro area. Nonetheless, given that
						other negative factors, notably financial conditions and confidence, have
						kept the euro area very weak, it could be argued that, in retrospect, there
						should have been less fiscal tightening in the past three to four years.
						However, with the consolidation that has taken place and with further,
						though more moderate, tightening in 2013 and 2014, underlying fiscal
						balances in the area as a whole and for most member countries will have
						reached a level that would lead to declining debt ratios at neutral interest
						rates and potential growth rates.<fnote id="ID-42-1249716">
							<p id="ID-42-1249713" indent="y" numbering="n">This characterisation of
								fiscal stances relies heavily on output gaps being as large as
								estimated, but in the current context uncertainty around estimates
								of economic slack is especially high. Other indicators, such as
								stubbornly high inflation in Italy, suggest that output gaps may be
								smaller than estimated.</p>
						</fnote> Nonetheless, most countries under market pressure, as well as
						France, are still planning consolidation of 2½ per cent of GDP or more over
						2013 and 2014 combined, which will further test the acceptance of fiscal
						austerity. The automatic stabilisers should be allowed to operate unhindered
						around the structural path embedded in current fiscal plans. Moreover, the
						focus on structural, as opposed to nominal, targets should be laid out in
						advance at the level of the European Union. For countries receiving official
						assistance, creditors’ acceptance and additional help would be needed to
						allow automatic stabilisers to work around the structural consolidation
						path. </p>

						Not all fiscal consolidation instruments are equal in terms of their impact

						fatigue. Among the better policies are reducing subsidies, adjusting pension
						age eligibility, increasing property taxes and eliminating certain tax
						expenditures. Among the worst instruments are cuts to education – unless
						accompanied by measures to exploit the significant scope for efficiency
						gains in many countries – and public investment. But perhaps because they
						are politically easier or faster to implement, some countries have so far
						largely relied on reducing investment-like expenditure, such as
						infrastructure spending (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"
							format="xref" refid="ID00a33cd3-b4f0-4a6c-b008-11d335cd6eb2"/>). For

						United Kingdom and the United States, and as much as two-fifths in Spain. In
						many countries, low long-term interest rates and excess capacity in the
						construction sector provide a propitious environment for financing
						growth-boosting infrastructure projects, not to mention that public
						infrastructure spending is typically found to have larger multipliers than
						other types of expenditure as it also boosts private investment. </p>

						generally, many countries with little revenue space and large public sectors

						increases to consolidate their budget positions. Between 2009 and 2012,
						about 90% of the consolidation effort in France has relied on increasing
						revenue, current primary spending having increased slightly, and 60% in the
						Netherlands. The proportion is about one half in the euro area as a whole
						and in Italy. Relying mostly on tax increases, which tend to have
						lower-than-average multipliers, may have merit in a period when economic
						conditions are very weak and the scope for further monetary policy
						accommodation is at best limited, but when economic recoveries begin or
						strengthen, the accent should shift to reducing public expenditure in
						countries with high public spending. Encouragingly, relative to the period
						since 2009, fiscal consolidation this year and next is generally projected

						high budget deficit and gross government debt rising to 90% of GDP in 2012,
						further fiscal consolidation is necessary to restore the sustainability of
						public finances. The authorities’ medium-term underlying fiscal
						consolidation plans, together with the use of the automatic stabilisers,
						should help combine sustained consolidation with necessary flexibility to
						meet unexpected output shocks. Several one-off factors have improved or will
						improve the headline deficit, most notably the transfer of the Royal Mail
						pension fund of 1.8% of GDP in 2012 and excess cash held at the Bank of
						England’s Asset Purchase Facility of 1% of GDP in 2013 and 0.7% of GDP in
						2014. Abstracting from one-off factors and cyclical developments, the
						underlying fiscal deficit increased slightly in 2012, but is assumed to fall
						by around 1% of GDP per year in both 2013 and 2014, which would ensure a
						credible consolidation path. Policy measures adopted in the Plan for Growth
						and 2013 budget to support the housing market are likely to encourage
						residential investment and supply, but without a sufficient supply response,
						some measures could create upward pressure on house prices. Continuing to
						shift the composition of public expenditure in favour of infrastructure
						investment would enhance growth prospects.</p>

						sector that has been prone to failure in the past. Defaults in this area,
						which are starting to occur, could markedly change investor attitudes to
						higher-risk investments and thereby lower capital formation. In addition, if
						the global recovery were to be slower than expected then growth in China
						would be adversely affected. On the upside, demographic factors could result
						in a renewed labour shortage during the recovery, raising real wages and
						consumption. The changes in value-added taxation could also impart more of a
						stimulus to the service sector than foreseen, boosting growth.</p>

							Firstly, increased pressures on public spending from health and

							cross-country variation and a much greater increase in some countries. A

							an intermediate <emphasis emph="italic">peak</emphasis> increase which
							is greater than the <emphasis emph="italic">average</emphasis> increase
							referred to above. Among the countries that require most consolidation,
							the peak measure in these projections is typically 2-4 percentage points
							of GDP higher than the average measure of consolidation. Finally,
							uncertainty is related to the loss in potential output due to the crisis
							and there is a risk that countries in which the recovery is delayed
							suffer further losses in potential output due to hysteresis effects

								(2013). The country coverage is all OECD countries as well as
								current non-OECD G20 countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, India,
								Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and South Africa),
								equivalent to about 90% of world GDP in 2010 at market exchange

								greater than for non-OECD economies, reflecting wider data
								availability for OECD countries, particularly in respect of fiscal

								>The backbone of the model is a consistent set of long-run
								projections for potential output. Potential output is based on a
								Cobb-Douglas production function with constant returns to scale
								featuring physical capital, human capital (based on gradually
								declining returns to average years of schooling) and labour as
								production factors plus labour-augmenting technological progress. By
								projecting these trend input components, assuming a degree of
								convergence in total factor productivity and human capital,
								potential output is projected out to 2060. The degree of convergence
								in total factor productivity depends on the starting point, with
								countries farther away from the technology frontier converging
								faster, but it also depends on the country’s own structural
								conditions and policies, hence the ’conditional convergence’
								nomenclature. In the long run, productivity in all countries will
								tend to grow at the same rate determined by the worldwide rate of
								technical progress, but cross-country GDP per capita gaps remain,
								mainly reflecting differences in technology levels, capital
								intensity, human capital and labour utilisation, which in turn
								partly depend on differences in structural conditions and
								policies.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1245884" indent="y" numbering="n">Private saving rates for
								OECD countries are determined according to recent OECD empirical
								work (Kerdrain <emphasis emph="italic">et al.,</emphasis> 2010)
								which suggests that demographic effects, captured by old-age and
								youth dependency ratios, are important drivers of long-term trends
								in saving, but with additional effects from the fiscal balance, the
								terms of trade, productivity growth, net oil balances and the
								availability of credit. Total saving in OECD countries is determined
								as the sum of public and private saving, although there is a 40%
								offset of any improvement in public saving from reduced private
								saving due to partial Ricardian equivalence (in line with recent
								OECD estimates, for example Röhn, 2011). For non-OECD countries, the
								total saving rate is determined according to an equation, which is
								close to being a total economy variant of the private saving
								equation for the OECD, with effects from the old-age and youth
								dependency ratios, the terms of trade, the availability of credit,
								the level of public expenditure (as a proxy for public social
								protection) and productivity growth. </p>
							<p id="ID-42-1245893" indent="y" numbering="n">Movements in global
								interest rates ensure that global saving and investment remain
								aligned, whereas imbalances at the national level are reflected in
								current account balances. An exception is a group of major non-OECD
								oil exporting countries, defined to include Saudi Arabia, Russia as
								well as 27 smaller non-OECD countries. For these countries, no
								individual projections of current balances are made. Rather, the
								combined current account balance of all non-OECD oil exporting
								countries is calculated based on projections of their balance of
								trade in oil. </p>
							<p id="ID-42-1245898" indent="y" numbering="n">Current account
								imbalances are accumulated to provide a proxy for foreign asset
								positions – with higher levels of external indebtedness leading to
								higher country-specific risk premiums that are reflected in market
								interest rates, consistent with the findings of Lane and
								Milesi-Ferret (2001) and Rose (2010). This is implemented as an
								increase of 2 basis points in interest rates for every percentage
								point increase in the ratio of net external debt to GDP. For
								countries that are net creditors, there is no discount placed on
								their domestic interest rate since no evidence for one has been
								found in empirical work.</p>
							<p id="ID-42-1245903" indent="y" numbering="n">Fiscal closure rules
								acting on the primary balance ensure that the ratio of government
								debt to GDP is stable either at recent levels or by targeting a
								specific (usually lower) debt-to-GDP ratio, which in the baseline
								here is 60%. Debt service responds to changes in debt and market
								interest rates, but with lags which reflect the maturity structure
								of debt. Higher debt levels are assumed to entail higher
								country-specific fiscal risk premia consistent with the findings of
								Égert (2010) and Laubach (2009): for every percentage point that the
								debt ratio exceeds a threshold of 75% of GDP, the fiscal risk
								premium applied to long-term interest rates increases by 2 basis
								points, with an additional increase of 2 basis points for every
								percentage point that the debt ratio exceeds 125%. No allowance for
								an additional interest rate premium is made for countries which do
								not have their own national currency. </p>

						OECD-wide interest rates are still projected to rise as output gaps close
						and policy rates normalise, lower government indebtedness will damp the rise
						in interest rates through a number of channels: firstly, it will lower
						fiscal risk premia, which are assumed to increase with the excess of
						government debt levels above 75% of GDP; secondly, to the extent that lower
						government debt reduces net external debt, it will also reduce
						country-specific risk premia on domestic interest rates; and finally,
						additional fiscal consolidation will boost global savings which will tend to
						reduce interest rates in all countries. Overall, fiscal consolidation in the
						baseline scenario reduces OECD real long-term interest rates by about
						50 basis points and, through this channel, boosts OECD potential growth by
						an average of about 0.1 percentage point per annum over the period to 2030,
						with larger effects on those countries undertaking most consolidation.
						Because consolidation requirements are typically greater in countries which
						are prone to running current account deficits, fiscal consolidation will
						also tend to reduce the scale of global imbalances (measured as the absolute
						sum of all current account balances normalised on world GDP) over the medium
						term by up to one-tenth (see also Box 1.3 in Chapter 1).<fnote

			<p id="ID-42-1365029" indent="y" numbering="n">This annex contains data on key economic
				series which provide a background to the recent economic developments in the OECD
				area described in the main body of this report. Data for 2012 to 2014 are OECD
				estimates and projections. The data in some of the tables have been adjusted to
				conform to internationally agreed concepts and definitions in order to make them
				more comparable across countries, as well as consistent with historical data shown
				in other OECD publications. Regional aggregates are based on weights that change
				each period, with the weights depending on the series considered. For details on
				aggregation, see OECD Economic Outlook Sources and Methods.</p>
			<p id="ID-42-1365055" indent="y" numbering="n">The OECD projection methods and
				underlying statistical concepts and sources are described in detail in OECD Economic
				Outlook Sources and Methods (<hyperlink

					>www.oecd.org/eco/sources‑and‑methods</hyperlink>).</p>

			<p id="ID-42-1365089" indent="y" numbering="n">The statistical data for Israel are

				Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of
				international law.</p>

					<p id="ID-42-1365209" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD quarterly projections are on
						a seasonal and working-day-adjusted basis for selected key variables. This
						implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may
						occur, though these in general are quite small. In some countries, official
						forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even
						when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the
						adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD.</p>
