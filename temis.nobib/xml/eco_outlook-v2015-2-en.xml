    Trade Winds Blowing No Good? </mainhead></heading><p id="ID63277214-d3f0-4e0c-8e8a-f1e703cbd5a2" instlang="en" indent="n" numbering="n">Global trade, which was already growing relatively slowly over the past few years, appears to have stagnated and even declined since late 2014. This is deeply concerning. Robust trade and global growth go hand in hand. Trade strengthens competition, keeping domestic firms fit and prices low, and expands variety for consumers and businesses. Technology transfer through trade contributes to the diffusion of new technologies and productivity growth. World trade has been a bellwether for global output. The growth rates of global trade observed so far in 2015 have, in the past, been associated with global recession. </p><p id="ID3f991473-3d6d-40cf-805e-e227c11aa50e" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Looking back, sluggish trade growth in 2012 and 2013 appears to have centered on the advanced countries, particularly reduced appetite for imports by US consumers and very slow GDP growth within Europe, which accounts for a large share of global trade. </p><p id="ID0c951e7f-5e07-452b-996a-b22119b94f48" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In 2015, by contrast, weak global trade growth centers on emerging markets. Developments in China appear to be at the heart of this. China’s transition from infrastructure investment and manufacturing and towards consumption and services is one important reason for the decline in commodity prices, and may be reducing its role in global value chains as well. Commodity exporters, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada and Russia, have been particularly affected, as have economies with close trade links to China, including Japan, Korea and South East Asian economies. On the financial front, equity market volatility may have tempered Chinese consumers’ optimism and imports. </p><p id="IDe9a24b49-da7e-42c0-9de7-4215f7bed2d9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Many economies, especially the emerging markets, face financial challenges, as well as a weaker outlook for their exports. Emerging market borrowing, mostly in the private sector, has expanded during the long period of very low global interest rates. Speculative portfolio capital repositioned itself during the middle of 2015, anticipating that the first rise in US policy interest rates would be in September. Following the stay of that policy action, this capital moved back into emerging markets. These large and volatile cross-border gross flows present acute challenges to emerging market policy makers, even if net flows are less than in previous periods of financial stress. </p><p id="IDb8b2dc27-758a-46b0-b7c5-20eb1ddb523a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Despite these growth weaknesses and financial vulnerabilities, the OECD’s projections in this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> show a modest revival of both world trade and GDP growth. In part, this is because policy actions are already being implemented that will help to address the weak underlying trends. For example, China has announced a range of stimulus measures including lowering bank lending rates and expanding infrastructure investment. These policy actions should help to put a floor under global commodity prices and stabilise commodity-exporting economies. But a fiscal strategy focused on social safety nets and environmental spending would both support demand and encourage the necessary rebalancing of the Chinese economy. </p><p id="ID1d4c39fa-d139-4d95-b174-bb15bfdf90ca" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Globally, all countries have some policy efforts in train to realise higher global growth, employment, and increase living standards. In Europe, policymakers should build on the recovery jump-started by the ECB to create more lasting economic dynamism. A fragmented financial system with high non-performing loans and high debt levels in households and non-financial firms inhibits new lending and reduces the effectiveness of monetary easing. Real investment would be enhanced by greater Europe-wide regulatory harmonization. On the fiscal side, collective action to increase public investment would increase growth sufficiently to reduce debt-to-GDP ratios, as long as investment projects are of high quality and supported by good structural policies. These policy actions would make European growth a driver of the global economy. </p><p id="IDfef93853-48fd-45b3-9069-f400b06207f5" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A collective approach to the recent surge in asylum-seekers arriving in the EU would help to reduce political tensions. Given the right policies, asylum-seekers need not impose an unmanageable economic burden. Indeed, if the refugees who stay are rapidly integrated into European societies, they are likely to benefit the host countries.</p><p id="ID9d7598e8-1027-4d6d-8f33-0ec73ed616d6" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In the United States, where GDP growth has been relatively robust and unemployment falling, wage growth has not yet started to pick up. Without wage growth, the recovery will lose steam, and prospects for the US to support the rebound in global trade and growth will come into question. Structural policies and reforms to tax and transfer systems may be the key to a more equitable distribution of income and a more sustainable growth path. </p><p id="ID118eb80b-35c1-43b7-8b2c-f000d2c49182" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">To aid the rebound in trade, policymakers need to turn back the rise in protectionism: according to the OECD-WTO-UNCTAD report to the G-20, countries have taken more than one thousand trade-restricting measures since the global crisis. Regional agreements like the TPP and TTIP would renew impetus towards trade liberalisation to support growth. </p><p id="ID8dfe901b-c28d-4622-b678-00a7ffe19f10" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Addressing climate change is critical for long-term economic sustainability and healthy growth. Collective action, in the context of COP21, is needed now. The current fragile state of economic recovery is not an excuse for policy inaction on climate change. In fact, a clear and predictable policy stance on climate would create a more positive environment for investment that would support growth and trade, as well as put us on a path to urgently-needed climate improvement.</p><p id="ID2a517afd-3883-4115-890f-5db145cb3dd5" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">9th November 2015</p><p id="ID-42-1363046" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"><graphic id="ID-42-1112609" graphic="signature_Mann" type="graphic"/></p><p id="ID03a76920-62fa-4623-a40b-2f71a1a6b383" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Catherine L.

A further sharp slowdown in emerging market economies (EMEs) is weighing on global activity and trade, and subdued investment and productivity growth is checking the momentum of the recovery in the advanced economies. Supportive macroeconomic policies and lower commodity prices are projected to strengthen global growth gradually through 2016 and 2017, but this outcome is far from certain given rising downside risks and vulnerabilities, and uncertainties about the path of policies and the response of trade and investment.</p><p id="ID01412ded-5663-49f8-86cd-f6c69d53653c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The outlook for the EMEs is a key source of global uncertainty at present, given their large contribution to global trade and GDP growth. In China, ensuring a smooth rebalancing of the economy, whilst avoiding a sharp reduction in GDP growth and containing financial stability risks, presents challenges. A more significant slowdown in Chinese domestic demand could hit financial market confidence and the growth prospects of many economies, including the advanced economies. For EMEs more broadly, challenges have increased, reflecting weaker commodity prices, tighter credit conditions and lower potential output growth, with the risk that capital outflows and sharp currency depreciations may expose financial vulnerabilities. Growth would also be hit in the euro area, as well as Japan, where the short-run impact of past stimulus has proved weaker than anticipated and uncertainty remains about future policy choices.</p><p id="IDd806704d-8918-4efc-8b17-0c4d71f91144" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">There are increasing signs that the anticipated path of potential output may fail to materialise in many economies, requiring a reassessment of monetary and fiscal policy strategies. The risk of such an outcome underlines the importance of implementing productivity-raising structural policies, alongside measures to reduce persisting negative supply effects from past demand weakness in labour markets and capital investment, whilst ensuring that macroeconomic policies continue to support growth and stability. Early and decisive actions to spur reductions in greenhouse gas emissions via predictable paths of policy including tax reforms, or public investment programmes, or action on research and development might also help to support short-term growth and improve longer-term prospects, as discussed in Chapter 2.</p></section><section id="ID3e9bf12f-6333-44e3-858e-6e2a74cce337" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDa7df0a6b-37c2-449a-9354-0d3c509daf4f">The outlook </mainhead></heading><p id="ID23d25772-002a-4fbb-b0a0-ed8a0a0adc70" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Global growth has eased to around 3% this year, well below its long-run average.

Deep recessions have emerged in Brazil and Russia, whilst the ongoing slowdown in China and the associated weakness of commodity prices has hit activity in key trading partners and commodity exporting economies, and increased financial market uncertainty. Global trade growth has slowed markedly, especially in the EMEs (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID10163383-d4aa-4c98-9d17-aa1dcce58105"/>), and financial conditions have become less supportive in most economies (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID812ff94f-b6ea-409d-940a-d9f78c5452d0"/>). Growth in the OECD economies has held up this year, at around 2%, implying a modest reduction in economic slack, helped by an upturn in private consumption growth. However, business investment remains subdued, raising questions about future potential growth rates and about the extent to which stronger growth in the advanced economies can help to overcome cyclical weakness in the EMEs.</p><figure id="IDa54c33c4-1e76-441c-a0aa-b2fdca19a127" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="1.1" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID54564fef-db96-4778-b32a-0d29634d6e38">Global GDP growth is set to recover slowly</figuremainhead></figureheading><figuresubheading><figuremainhead id="IDd44ec3fb-0396-4629-8d01-431f3584fa90">Year-on-year percentage changes</figuremainhead></figuresubheading><graphic id="ID-42-1111244" graphic="CHAP1_FIG1_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><source type="sing"><p id="ID273a53f0-13de-4253-9336-25dc6d3b169e" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD Economic Outlook 98 database.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933295759" target="statlink"/></figure><figure id="ID10163383-d4aa-4c98-9d17-aa1dcce58105" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="1.2" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID5b26a26e-bc72-4335-90df-ab00a0b5d5c6">Global import volume growth has slowed this year</figuremainhead></figureheading><graphic id="ID-42-1111323" graphic="CHAP1_FIG2_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><source type="sing"><p id="ID0ccacd67-db91-4751-878c-b05b43d577d8" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD Economic Outlook 98 database.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933295763" target="statlink"/></figure><figure id="ID812ff94f-b6ea-409d-940a-d9f78c5452d0" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="1.3" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID0d9a9b99-c2e5-422d-b0e3-c9c10f990064">Financial conditions in advanced economies have become less supportive</figuremainhead></figureheading><figuresubheading><figuremainhead id="ID7f7ea18e-79db-48f9-bb06-dacf122b634a">OECD financial conditions index</figuremainhead></figuresubheading><graphic id="ID-42-1111491" graphic="CHAP1_FIG3_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><fignote id="IDafbe98e2-d64e-488e-a9af-bb57b88f6965" type="note"><p id="ID5f5e2845-54c6-413d-8133-86063ca2f42c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The OECD Financial Conditions Index is a weighted average of real short and long-term interest rates, real exchange rate, bank credit conditions, household wealth and the yield spread between corporate and government long-term bonds.

The decline in oil prices since mid-2014 could add between ¼ and ½ percentage point to OECD GDP growth in 2016, with the further drop of over 20% since June 2015 contributing around 0.1-0.2 percentage point of this.<fnote id="IDd0d36488-c5ba-4527-aaa6-b1c51c3dedb6"><p id="IDf85e959e-7294-4d97-b052-6f7256ac3eed" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Estimates relative to a baseline with oil prices held at their mid-2014 levels, based on simulations using the NiGEM global macroeconomic model, augmented with OECD estimates of supply responses in OECD net oil exporters and the United States.

The so far muted recovery in the euro area is set to strengthen somewhat, with GDP growth at around 1¾-2% per annum over 2016‑17, helped by the continued accommodative monetary policy stance and the stimulatory impact of lower oil prices. Fiscal support of up to ¼ per cent of GDP to assist asylum seekers should provide a small additional stimulus to demand. The outlook for Japan remains softer than in other advanced economies, despite an anticipated upturn in real
wage growth. This reflects a larger drag exerted by weak external demand, especially in Asia, and strong fiscal headwinds, particularly from the further consumption tax increase planned for 2017. Given the modest upturn projected in domestic and global activity, a gentle strengthening of investment spending is projected in the OECD economies over 2016-17. Business investment growth is projected to rise by just under 4¼ per cent per annum in the next two years, after rising by an estimated 3¼ per cent per annum over 2014-2015.</p></li><li id="d1e95" numbering="n"><p id="IDca7ec143-90b8-4e2e-aa28-67283934782b" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Growth in the EMEs is projected to turn up through 2016-17, helped initially by the easing of the sharp downturns in 2015 in the major commodity producers and the small open Asian economies. Even so, growth prospects are likely to continue to diverge in the large EMEs (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID6907311a-9231-426e-b340-7d73e3948d64"/>). A gradual slowdown is projected to continue in China, with GDP growth easing to 6¼ per cent by 2017 and import penetration declining. New fiscal measures announced this year, worth up to 1½ per cent of GDP, along with small additional measures in the next two years should help to support demand but will check the pace at which the economy rebalances. Growth prospects in India should remain relatively robust, provided further progress is made in implementing structural reforms. This reflects the more positive outlook for investment and consumption and its position as a major net importer of commodities. Despite large currency depreciations, recovery will be only gradual in Brazil and Russia as confidence firms after an initial stabilisation of activity, given soft external demand, still high inflation and limited space for macroeconomic policy support. Growth in Indonesia should pick up slowly, helped by the implementation of plans to boost infrastructure investment. </p></li></randlist><figure id="ID6907311a-9231-426e-b340-7d73e3948d64" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="1.4" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID5722a39f-0697-4cb7-9a42-0cb42c80f1f1">GDP growth projections for the major economies</figuremainhead></figureheading><graphic id="ID-42-1111621" graphic="CHAP1_FIG4_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><fignote id="ID-42-1179991" type="number"><p id="ID-42-1180031" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Fiscal years.</p></fignote><source type="sing"><p id="IDad5ec183-86cf-4917-9315-04448f322f80" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD Economic Outlook 98 database.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933295788" target="statlink"/></figure><p id="IDc37e9a7f-e995-47d6-9af4-11aae4497c51" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Inflationary pressures remain weak in the major OECD economies and in China, but have edged up in several other EMEs, particularly those in which large currency depreciations have occurred. </p><randlist type="bullet"><li id="d1e143" numbering="n"><p id="ID9997793f-0bc2-46d0-bf45-71567e712036" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Headline consumer price inflation has fallen in recent months in the OECD economies, following the further sharp decline in commodity prices, and market-based measures of inflation expectations have edged down further.

Estimating the number of arrivals remains very challenging, but over one million asylum applications could be received this year in the European Union (EU), up from 630 thousand applications in 2014, with an estimated 350-450 thousand people likely to be granted refugee or other humanitarian status (equivalent to 0.07-0.09% of the EU population). Large inflows of asylum seekers are also continuing in Turkey, where the number of registered refugees from Syria alone is now above 2 million, having risen so far in 2015 by over 350 thousand people. Additional sizeable arrivals seem possible over 2016-17, including from follow-on migration arising from <shortcitation>friends and family</shortcitation> type effects (Mitchell et al., 2011).</p><p id="ID08db55d7-c568-4297-be0c-02ea84571791" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The numbers and the heterogeneity of the new refugees make this inflow particularly difficult to address (OECD, 2015d,e). Asylum seekers are arriving from a diverse group of countries (across MENA, South Asia and Eastern Europe), and with a varied range of skills. This has put a strain on processing and settlement systems, and raises the challenges involved in integrating new arrivals into societies. The upfront costs of integrating asylum seekers are also likely to be higher than for economic migrants. The numbers of new entrants have also resulted in some temporary border closures within the Schengen area. Appropriate policy   choices   in   host   countries   can   help   to   minimise   the   possible    short-run    challenges    of    absorbing    a sudden large inflow of new asylum applicants and maximise the longer-run benefits that might result. A key point is to ensure that there are no barriers that prevent newly-accepted refugees from ultimately moving to locations in the EU that reflect economic conditions rather than other differences.</p><p id="ID-42-1124508" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The new surge of asylum seekers into the European Union comes on top of an already-sizeable number of economic migrants into the area, although both are small relative to aggregate EU population (see figure below). In 2014, there were nearly 1 million immigrants to the EU-28 from non-member countries. The number of individuals who gained refugee or other humanitarian status, on a first-time decision basis, was around 160 thousand, less than half of the numbers expected in 2015, with further decisions likely in 2016. The new EU arrivals in 2015 seem likely to largely settle in three economies – Germany (where around 900 thousand new asylum seekers are anticipated), Austria and Sweden (where 140-190 thousand new asylum seekers are projected this year and 100-170 thousand in 2016). Most other EU economies will receive a small number of new arrivals.</p><boxsection id="ID-42-1124513" instlang="en" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID-42-1124519">Effects on fiscal positions </mainhead></heading><p id="ID-42-1124525" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Estimating the economic impact on host-nations of the sharp rise in refugees is difficult for a number of reasons: there is limited research on the impact of large refugee inflows on advanced economies, with most research focusing on the impact of increased total immigration (of which the share of refugees is usually quite small); different countries have different lags associated with the time it takes to process asylum-seekers, and further lags and restrictions may be associated with the ability for refugees to enter into local labour markets. The unprecedented nature and uniqueness of the current crisis makes it difficult to draw lessons from previous episodes. </p><p id="ID-42-1124530" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Estimates of the short to medium-term fiscal impact of total immigration are quite varied across studies, but usually small, with some indicating net fiscal benefits and others net fiscal costs to host countries (OECD, 2013b; Dustman and Fratini, 2014). Short-term expenditure required to help support newly-arrived asylum seekers include: humanitarian assistance to provide food and shelter and basic income support; up-front expenditures associated with necessary language training and schooling; steps to identify the true skills of migrants and the expenditures associated with processing additional asylum claims. Additional support may be required in the medium term to assist new entrants enter the labour market. A possible longer-term benefit from the new arrivals is that they will help to improve the sustainability of pension systems, particularly in economies where there might otherwise be pressures due to population ageing.</p><p id="ID-42-1124535" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In most of the main countries affected by the present surge of asylum seekers, the additional expenditures announced so far have been relatively modest. Germany has projected an additional ¼ per cent of GDP support this year and ½ per cent of GDP support per annum through to 2017 to meet initial needs of newly-arrived immigrants and to integrate them in the labour market. Austria projects that spending on refugees and asylum seekers will rise from 0.1% of GDP in 2014 to 0.15% of GDP in 2015 and 0.3% of GDP in 2016. Sweden, which has been a major host country for refugees for a number of years, has budgeted for additional spending in 2016 of 0.9% of GDP to improve the integration of newly-arrived immigrants. Hungary, an important transit country into the Schengen area, has announced additional spending of 0.1% of GDP in 2015, to cover costs associated with the new flows of refugees. Since 2011, the Turkish government has provided aid to Syrian refugees amounting to 0.8% of 2014 GDP. The European Commission has announced funding of e9.2 billion to address the refugee crisis over 2015-16 (0.1% of EU GDP). </p><figure id="ID-42-1127991" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" numbering="n" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID-42-1127997">The number of refugees into Europe is rising

In part, the current trade slowdown reflects weaker global GDP growth. But the slowdown has been more pronounced than might have been expected on the basis of past relationships with global output growth, even given the post-crisis decline in the elasticity of trade to output. In the early stages of the recovery, moderate trade growth largely reflected weak demand in the advanced economies, especially in the trade-intensive euro area (Ollivaud and Schwellnus, 2015). More recently, the weakness stems from the EMEs. A substantial proportion of the overall slowdown in global trade growth this year relative to 2014 is accounted for by a decline in import volumes in the non-OECD economies (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID10163383-d4aa-4c98-9d17-aa1dcce58105"/>), reflecting both weaker demand growth and a reduction in import intensity. This has contributed to weaker external demand in the advanced economies. All told, the slowdown in non-OECD import demand this year and next, relative to earlier projections (OECD, 2015a), is likely to reduce OECD GDP growth by 0.4 percentage point per annum, all else equal.</p><figure id="ID344bc373-7129-48ef-bc28-e8f6bfd5c777" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="1.7" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID9de48e14-4c09-4341-b25c-750df0782015">Global trade growth is unusually weak this year</figuremainhead></figureheading><figuresubheading><figuremainhead id="ID87f64085-b333-4ff5-8b6e-6f81030c40d6">Year-on-year percentage changes</figuremainhead></figuresubheading><graphic id="ID-42-1112165" graphic="CHAP1_FIG7_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><fignote id="ID910c8422-b4cf-405d-9bb1-09991d45e9f0" type="note"><p id="IDbd31859f-eac0-438d-b657-08dd54da7d3d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Global trade is goods plus services trade volumes.

Reported GDP growth has continued to moderate in 2015, to just over 6¾ per cent, as the economy transitions from industrial to services-based growth and deals with the imbalances in property and heavy industries and the high debt levels in local government and the corporate sector (OECD, 2015c). Achieving a smooth unwinding of these imbalances presents challenges, raising the risk that an abrupt slowdown could occur with adverse effects for the global economy. Hence, a closer look at the economic transition in China is warranted.</p><p id="ID7991ab4f-82b3-408d-82c5-75303777dcd9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Reflecting ongoing rebalancing, consumption (public plus private) has become a relatively more important source of growth in China than fixed investment (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDbf4d58bc-a52d-4bd0-9ca7-3d0e985ecb20"/>), even though the growth rate of both types of expenditure is now weaker than in the past. The services sector is now the main driver of economic growth, whilst industrial production growth has slowed sharply to the weakest rate since 2008. At the same time, the easing of total final expenditure growth, with export volumes declining, is prompting concerns that the slowdown in China could be deeper and progressing more rapidly than initially thought, with negative spillover effects via trade and financial linkages. </p><figure id="IDbf4d58bc-a52d-4bd0-9ca7-3d0e985ecb20" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="1.12" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID0ddf072f-946d-4edc-8753-baf15a22e10b"> Rebalancing is continuing in China</figuremainhead></figureheading><figuresubheading><figuremainhead id="ID-42-1180228">GDP growth by sector</figuremainhead></figuresubheading><graphic id="ID-42-1343511" graphic="CHAP1_FIG12_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><fignote id="ID1c282e0f-1f60-4116-b1f4-2d3ef43fcce7" type="note"><p id="IDd37a9e9d-19e2-4fae-8b0b-bc8268c9f433" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Shares do not add to 100 since the net exports share is not included in the chart.</p></fignote><fignote id="ID8f4ee8c2-aa7c-4981-8d3d-4db266db213f" type="number"><p id="IDa3e13e27-ef03-4ae4-9cea-90afad67ce8d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Total consumption includes both public and private consumption.</p></fignote><fignote id="ID730f9250-e062-4961-8a12-f6b29bb7855b" type="number"><p id="IDfb4f01cd-2b8e-4d7e-993f-d8ca78ef427a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Dots represent the contribution to the growth of GDP in the first three quarters of 2015 relative to a year earlier.</p></fignote><source type="sing"><p id="IDbf8633e4-376d-4bf7-b140-80eac2ebc20a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD Economic Outlook 98 database; National Bureau of Statistics (China); and Thomson Reuters.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933295864" target="statlink"/></figure><randlist type="bullet"><li id="d1e451" numbering="n"><p id="IDf20377cf-d43d-4257-a2d8-e0381585bd08" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Trade linkages understate the extent to which many advanced economies are exposed to a slowdown in China, given the additional direct sales in China by the foreign affiliates of parent companies from these countries.

Sales of the local subsidiaries of Japanese manufacturers in China in 2014 were also almost double Japanese merchandise exports to China.

China has become the leading location for international foreign direct investment flows in recent years (OECD, 2015b), but only hosts around 4¼ per cent of the total global inward FDI stock (excluding that located in Hong Kong). Nevertheless, financial spillovers may be stronger than these data suggest, as demonstrated by the sharp reaction in global financial markets to the large correction in Chinese share prices since June and the unexpected depreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar in August.

The new fiscal measures, which are about one-quarter the size of those introduced in 2009 during the global financial crisis, are largely intended to finance additional infrastructure spending, particularly on transport networks. This support is projected to help hold up demand, with GDP growth expected to slow modestly to 6¼ per cent by 2017, but will inevitably slow the necessary rebalancing of expenditure that needs to occur and entails the risk that leverage and excess industrial capacity might increase further. The additional investment will moderate the trend reduction in the import intensity of domestic demand, helping to underpin global trade growth. A range of other structural policies could prove more effective for rebalancing overall, including services liberalisation and expanding social expenditures to support household consumption growth. Measures of this kind would help the transition in the Chinese economy, but would not offer as much support for global trade, given the lower import intensity of consumption spending.</p><p id="ID840508e5-ee78-4131-8ac2-65fcddceb468" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">If Chinese domestic demand were to slow by more than currently anticipated, the global repercussions could be sizeable (Gauvin and Rebillard, 2015) and more severe than implied only by direct trade and financial linkages, given indirect confidence effects in financial markets.

If any of these conditions fail to hold, growth would be weaker than projected. Further currency depreciations would exacerbate underlying inflationary pressures in some of these economies, requiring tighter monetary policy, but providing more external stimulus. Failure to reduce political uncertainty and restore confidence in several EMEs, including Brazil, Russia and Turkey, would undermine growth. Commodity prices are a balanced risk. If recent conditions of excess supply were to persist or intensify, lower commodity prices would reduce the revenues of commodity producers, including Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Russia and other oil producers, weigh on real activity and government revenues and weaken external positions. Alternatively, if global demand were to strengthen more than projected, or if geopolitical risks were to intensify, commodity prices could strengthen, raising the revenues of commodity producers. </p><p id="ID998960fa-c17e-478e-a263-e63c5b4741b2" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">EMEs are also subject to possible risks associated with the eventual US monetary policy normalisation. Along with weaker growth outcomes, the anticipation of tighter monetary policy in the United States has contributed to greater portfolio rebalancing away from EME assets in recent months, with gross capital inflows falling, sovereign bond spreads widening and equity prices declining by between 10% and 15% since early May (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID3963f90b-ef7e-460f-9a27-613a2f51c49c"/>).

Thus, an alignment of financial market expectations with the FOMC views could imply that 10-year US government bond yields increase by around 1 percentage point, with a risk that similar increases occur in EMEs bond rates. Higher increases may even occur because term premia – which have been at historic lows – will probably rise as well. This would likely trigger global adjustments in corporate bond and equity prices.</p></fnote> This could then trigger further portfolio flows and asset price changes, exposing underlying vulnerabilities. The volatile nature of investors’ sentiment, contagion and negative feedback loops make the size, duration and economic effects of portfolio and price shifts hard to predict.

Indeed, according to balance of payments data, during the US monetary policy tightening episodes from 1994-95 and 1999-2000, bond and equity capital flows to selected EMEs declined on aggregate, though with some cross-country differences (figure below).

As EMEs are viewed as higher-risk markets, they are prone to a flight to safety by investors.

They could reflect specification errors and may not incorporate ongoing structural changes, such as the limited impact that interest rates now appear to have on business investment (OECD, 2015b), particularly at a time of heightened uncertainty. Downward rigidities in nominal wages and prices may also generate asymmetric responses to large declines or rises in oil prices, rather than the similar effects embodied in standard macro-models (Raciborski et al., 2015). In the euro area, monetary policy stimulus could also be weakened by the still impaired credit channel. </p><p id="ID-42-1155735" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The declining sensitivity of trade volumes to changes in competitiveness (Ollivaud et al., 2015) may also account for the lower than expected effects from past exchange rate depreciations. In the euro area, export performance has improved in 2015, with export volumes rising twice as quickly as export market growth, suggesting that the real exchange rate has had some impact. However, there is little evidence of such effects on imports, with import growth accelerating this year relative to total final expenditure. For Japan, the further exchange rate depreciation since mid-2014 came on top of a larger decline in the previous year. The initial decline boosted export performance in 2014, but the further decline has had little observed impact on performance this year.</p><p id="ID-42-1155740" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Finally, it might also be the case that growth has been weaker than expected because the positive impact of the economic shocks has been added to an overoptimistic baseline projection, as it frequently has been for year-ahead forecasts in the aftermath of the crisis (OECD, 2014a).

A focus on national measures of economic slack may also be less relevant for inflation developments in the context of more globally-integrated output and factor markets. There is also uncertainty about the sources of economic slack. Traditional measures of labour-market slack may also be too narrow, failing to capture the post-crisis rise in the number of involuntary part-time workers and inactive persons wanting to work but not registered as job seekers. </p><p id="IDf1221389-2036-4818-9884-a72c308db3e7" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">There is also significant uncertainty about future potential growth rates, and in particular about trend productivity growth rates. Since the beginning of the financial crisis weak domestic and foreign demand, greater financial constraints and persistent uncertainties have discouraged investment. In addition, public and infrastructure investments have been held back in some countries by fiscal consolidation. Overall, the sluggish recovery in investment is estimated to account for over half of the slowdown in the growth rate of OECD potential output per capita in recent years compared to pre-crisis averages (OECD, 2015a). The crisis may also have depressed the supply of labour in the wake of the crisis, notably in the euro area. High skill mismatch and a slowing of the pace at which new innovations spread out throughout the economy may have contributed to lower labour productivity growth (Adalet McGowan et al<emphasis emph="italic">.</emphasis>, 2015). A slower pace of product-market reforms may also have played a role. Some of the slowdown in trend productivity that started in the 2000s could be long-lasting if policies fail to respond.</p></section></section><section id="ID0f71abd1-a458-42ac-b713-7401c7b95a01" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID21eba27d-e544-4fa0-9ee2-938ff375e7f5">Policy requirements</mainhead></heading><section id="ID29a50096-28e3-4143-9776-302dbece9b1e" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID5d004d65-bba7-4cf0-a177-a45faed66b3d">Macroeconomic policies in advanced and emerging market economies</mainhead></heading><p id="IDe25e1c96-7041-48dc-8b37-ee4ae5153d05" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The main advanced economies require continued policy support to stimulate aggregate demand and strengthen potential growth. </p><randlist type="bullet"><li id="d1e843" numbering="n"><p id="IDd197eab7-edc1-424e-b54d-da72dae27868" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Differences in expected growth and inflation developments call for increasingly divergent monetary policy stances.

Joint action to generate profitable investment opportunities by removing or reducing border protection would also help to boost growth prospects. Co-ordinated international action to combat climate change could also help underpin a surge in new investments. As argued in Chapter 2, ambitious measures to help lower greenhouse gas emissions can fit well with the need to stimulate investment and technical progress.

The rationale for such investments is that they could help to push economies onto a higher growth path than might otherwise be the case, at a time when private investment growth remains modest. Two scenarios are considered: the first is with a collective increase in public investment in the OECD economies; the second is with separate increases in public investment in one economy at a time, with such investment remaining unchanged in the other OECD economies.</p><p id="ID58ce5c96-ce7e-49c5-84ba-966a7e8d1f9f" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Public investment is assumed to be increased by ½ per cent of GDP for two years in each economy, implying an increase in the volume of government investment of around 15% in the typical OECD member state. In some countries this may be challenging to achieve immediately. The analysis nonetheless assumes that the projects undertaken are economically worthwhile, with net benefits to the economy. </p><p id="ID-42-1157668" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Collective action to increase public investment can be expected to boost the initial domestic multiplier effects from the stimulus, since private investment and exports in each economy will benefit from stronger demand in other economies (Barrell et al., 2012; OECD, 2015b). Monetary policy is assumed to be accommodative, with policy interest rates held fixed. This is likely to further increase the short-term positive effect on growth, all else equal, since real interest rates decline as inflation edges up following the demand stimulus. Budget solvency rules are also switched off, so that the higher level of investment spending initially raises the budget deficit; the implications of imposing budget solvency are discussed below. Finally, the multiplier effects from an investment-led stimulus are likely to be a little larger than from other forms of fiscal stimulus, since the former also has small, but positive, supply-side effects (Coenen et al., 2012). </p><p id="ID-42-1157673" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The first-year multiplier from the collective stimulus is above 1, with OECD GDP rising by over 0.6% (see first figure below), and GDP rising by over 0.5% in each of the major economies. The impact is larger in Japan and the United States than in the euro area, the United Kingdom and Canada, since the latter economies are more open, so that a larger proportion of the stimulus is offset by higher imports. Stronger demand in the OECD economies also boosts the major EMEs, with GDP in the BRIICS rising by around ¼ percentage point. All told, global GDP rises by a little over 0.4%. Reflecting the comparatively high import content of investment spending, global trade rises by over 1% in the first year. The growth effects could be even stronger if the additional public investment was concentrated in network industries, particularly in the EU, where there is a greater possibility of crowding in private investment (OECD, 2015b). The first-year effects on GDP are lower by around 20-25% in the United States, Japan and the euro area if the investment shock is conducted separately for each of these economies and around 40% lower in the United Kingdom and Canada. Thus, there are clear benefits from undertaking collective action to boost public investment.</p><p id="ID-42-1157678" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The initial increase of ½ per cent of GDP in the budget deficit from stronger expenditure is offset in part by the favourable fiscal effects of stronger economic activity, so that the first-year increase in the budget deficit is below ½ per cent of GDP (see second figure below, Panel A). The offset in the collective action scenario is around one-quarter in the euro area, the United Kingdom and Canada, but one-third or more in Japan and the United States, reflecting the comparatively stronger initial boost to activity. The budgetary offsets are smaller in the go-it-alone scenario, reflecting the weaker activity effects that result.</p><p id="ID-42-1157683" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Government debt-to-GDP ratios decline in the first year in the collective action scenario, despite the increase in the deficit-to-GDP ratio (see second figure below, Panel B). This is because the favourable impact of the increase in (nominal) GDP on the debt-to-GDP ratio more than offsets the impact of the higher budget deficit. The decline is largest in Japan, reflecting both the sizeable impact of the stimulus on activity and the high initial government debt-to-GDP ratio. In the alternative scenario, with the shock conducted separately for each economy, there are still first year declines in the debt-to-GDP ratio in Japan, the United States and the euro area, but the declines in Canada and the United Kingdom are almost entirely eliminated. </p><p id="ID-42-1175138" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the second year of the collective action scenario (not shown here), there is a small additional increase in GDP growth in the OECD economies, reflecting second-round effects from increased global activity and the impact of a decline in real interest rates. The level of OECD GDP is around 0.8% above baseline. Government deficit-to-GDP ratios remain above their baseline values, by around ¼ per cent of GDP in most major OECD economies (0.1% of GDP in Japan), but debt-to-GDP ratios are below their baseline levels. In contrast, debt-to-GDP ratios are higher than in the baseline in the United Kingdom and Canada when the government investment is shock conducted separately for each economy.</p><figure id="ID-42-1158460" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" numbering="n" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID-42-1158466">First-year GDP effects of a government investment stimulus in OECD economies</figuremainhead></figureheading><figuresubheading><figuremainhead id="ID-42-1158475">First-year change from baseline</figuremainhead></figuresubheading><graphic id="ID-42-1158480" graphic="CHAP1_BOX6_FIG1_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><fignote id="ID-42-1158485" type="note"><p id="ID-42-1158488" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Based on a two-year increase in the level of government investment equivalent to ½ per cent of GDP per annum in all OECD countries (Collective) and separately in the United States, Japan, the euro area, the United Kingdom and Canada (Non-Collective).</p></fignote><source type="sing"><p id="ID-42-1158497" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD calculations.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933296009" target="statlink"/></figure><p id="ID-42-1158515" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">If the budget solvency rule in NiGEM is allowed to operate, the increase in expenditure is offset by an increase in direct taxes on households to bring the budget balance back to its baseline level by the second year in both of the scenarios considered.

To this end, a strengthening of bank supervision, debt enforcement and insolvency frameworks is needed. Also, the resolution of the large amount of distressed debt on banks’ balance sheet would be facilitated by the development of a market for such assets. Banks’ losses need to be recognised swiftly, even if this requires injections of public money to recapitalise banks or an orderly wind-down of insolvent institutions. In the longer term, banking and capital market union is needed to ensure a well-functioning banking system.</p><p id="IDcd0dba75-2dfd-465a-a4e8-3911d560b08b" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">If financial market tensions were to occur and result in significantly tighter financial conditions and thus weaker economic growth, an offset from macroeconomic policies would be needed. It should involve either postponing planned tightening or adding additional stimulus, from both fiscal and monetary policies, with the appropriate policy mix depending on country-specific situations and the room available for policy action. The ensuing, even more protracted, environment of very low interest rates would raise financial stability risks. </p><p id="ID42e1d894-d466-4d59-a0a4-2688bf84ab38" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The scope for policy to respond to flagging economic growth varies across EMEs, reflecting existing economic imbalances and vulnerabilities. China still has further room for monetary and fiscal stimulus, even after recent stimulus measures, but may have to accept a slower rate of growth as the economy rebalances. Policy stimulus should be designed to avoid aggravating current financial vulnerabilities. In many EMEs, including Brazil, the rapidly deteriorating fiscal situation means that there is little room for stimulus beyond automatic stabilisers. The prospective normalisation of policy interest rates in the United States poses challenges for EMEs. With globally integrated financial markets, it may be difficult for them to respond to any interest rate increases in the United States and to any associated depreciation of their currencies or capital outflows. Such developments could prompt monetary authorities in EMEs to raise interest rates to address threats to price and financial stability, especially if inflation expectations are poorly anchored. This could damp economic activity if not offset by fiscal stimulus. </p><p id="ID841192a7-7fb8-4410-87ae-8a06f382cc3d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In EMEs, trade-offs stemming from the need to ensure simultaneously price, financial and growth stability, at a time of increasing international spillovers, require the use of multiple instruments and ensuring that there is sufficient room for policy response. Some spillovers via gross credit flows and leverage, leading to excessive debt build-up and international exposure, could be addressed by macro-prudential policies. Many EMEs are already using such policies to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector (Box 1.5 in OECD (2013a)). They should be accompanied by close monitoring of non-performing loans and bank capitalisation by bank regulators, with regular stress tests. Proper bankruptcy and loan restructuring rules should also be in place. </p><p id="ID61312024-409f-4add-b432-d953f8262b34" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Financial market stability in EMEs could be strengthened by structural reforms. A higher share of FDI liabilities in total foreign liabilities reduces the risks of volatile capital flows. Such a safer structure of liabilities could be promoted by reducing regulatory burdens on foreign direct investment and product markets, and removing tax incentives for debt over equity financing (Ahrend and Goujard, 2012). Re-starting growth-enhancing structural reforms would also help improve economic prospects more generally and boost investors’ confidence. </p></section><section id="IDe381ffa6-915e-4696-8aed-088869e592d5" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID27725360-046d-401c-97ba-45606b029827">Implications of weaker and uncertain potential growth for macroeconomic policies in advanced economies</mainhead></heading><p id="ID696f31a3-dea0-401b-928f-f20ab8375c03" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Weaker potential growth (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID8c152d2b-223e-478e-9622-863ab886bb2f"/>) and heightened uncertainties have implications for fiscal assessments: </p><randlist type="bullet"><li id="d1e945" numbering="n"><p id="ID2d5f6ecd-a999-4a67-bc9e-8f0b503b5183" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In the short term, smaller output gaps and weaker growth make fiscal targets more difficult to achieve, because there will be less <shortcitation>bonus</shortcitation> from a cyclical recovery (or the structural deficit is closer to the actual deficit than assumed).

Indeed, if multipliers are sufficiently high, fiscal consolidation could worsen debt-to-GDP ratios, as the reduction in the level of debt would be more than offset by the negative impact on GDP, especially in economies where the debt ratio is high and automatic stabilisers are large. </p><p id="ID003e0b42-ca75-4dee-af1e-dfd6a56dcdd0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">One reason for weak potential output growth at present is weak investment growth, both public and private. This has implications for the composition of fiscal packages. In particular, cutting public investment, whose multiplier is estimated to be higher than those of other spending components (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012; Gechert et al., 2015) could result in higher debt ratios, and harm both actual and potential output growth. Conversely, collective action to raise good-quality public investment, particularly at a time of low long-term financing costs, might boost growth and reduce debt ratios, notably in highly indebted countries (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDf112b5af-fbf3-46be-8910-0cd399565d70"/>). </p><p id="ID319a1b59-3fa9-4872-a0b1-c7c8ad4621e3" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">More broadly, strategies to reduce debt should focus on measures that do not have a large negative short-term effect on growth. In economies where the recovery is still fragile, it may be appropriate to reverse consolidation, if the right policies can be implemented, to allow a period of more robust GDP growth after which adjustment measures can be taken when normal economic conditions prevail and fiscal multipliers are lower. </p><p id="IDe5ddfa1f-07a7-4034-a573-8a082abfd44a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Weaker potential growth and high uncertainty also matter for monetary policy. Although the link between the estimated output gap and inflation has been weak, reduced spare capacity would imply stronger inflationary pressures and possibly the need to tighten policy rates faster. However, a permanent reduction in potential growth would also imply a lower neutral interest rate and thus weaker stimulus from the current level of policy rates, slowing output dynamics. Greater reliance on current inflation developments and expectations and survey-based measures of economic slack could be a particularly useful guide for policymakers at present, given the extensive uncertainty around the extent of current slack and of future productivity growth (Orphanides, 2003; Pain and Röhn, 2011). </p><p id="ID95a4e5d1-fc2e-4e41-9fdc-91301ffde460" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Overall, even if there is a risk that potential growth may be weaker than predicted, tightening policies at present is generally unwarranted. It will be important to resist the pressure to implement pro-cyclical policy, especially in the euro area where demand is still depressed. Rigidity in labour markets and inertia in fixed investment decisions strengthen the case for such a strategy.</p></section></section><biblio id="d1e991" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDcaf39bd3-4e7f-445c-b8f7-4f39628f3d63">Bibliography</mainhead></heading><p id="IDc3096482-8491-4da0-9394-8c6106657924" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Aaronson, D., L. Hu, A. Seifoddini and D. Sullivan (2014), <shortcitation>Declining Labor Force Participation and its Implications for Unemployment and Employment Growth</shortcitation>, <emphasis emph="italic">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Economic Perspectives</emphasis>, No. 38.</p><p id="IDc748dd4e-7661-4409-9aaa-adaa9fe6ac23" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Adalet McGowan M., D.

On current trends and policies, greenhouse gas emissions over the next 50 years will cause damaging changes in the world’s climate. This is true especially, but not only, in some of the poorer and emerging market economies. Furthermore, the climate system is sensitive to, and subject to, threshold effects; the potential for very rapid changes - whose effects may not be manageable, even catastrophic - will increase significantly if temperatures rise too far (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5fc8980d-9a11-4aea-8361-781522753ffb"/>). To keep these risks down, ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are required, more ambitious than embodied in this year's independent nationally determined commitments (INDC), along with the decisive policy actions needed to achieve those reductions (IEA, 2015a). To have a chance of keeping climate change within acceptable limits, the world will have to move to zero net carbon emissions before the end of the century (IPCC, 2014a).</p><figure id="ID5fc8980d-9a11-4aea-8361-781522753ffb" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="2.1" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="IDea3b05a4-d76b-4922-9dd0-2dd94a8f9229">Level of additional risk due to climate change</figuremainhead></figureheading><figuresubheading><figuremainhead id="ID8c2b5eb9-c52b-463f-b4cc-bb51871c71b3">Global mean temperature change,relative to 1986–2005</figuremainhead></figuresubheading><graphic id="ID-42-1347155" graphic="CHAP3_FIG1_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><source type="sing"><p id="ID59c65612-d731-4640-ac60-49b6b70163f6" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Adapted from Figure 1, Box 2.4 in IPCC(2014c), 5th Annual Synthesis Report.</p></source></figure><p id="ID929e59d0-aab3-4f9f-bcd4-264181fa7489" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Set against the fragility of the short-term macroeconomic situation in many countries, this long-term concern might seem less urgent. Costly action on climate change may be thought to add to the short-term economic problems. On the contrary, however, a credible plan of action to reduce emissions over the longer term, including firm measures to change the path of emissions in the near future, can complement measures taken to promote economic recovery. Studies suggest that, once economies adjust to new policies, the cost in terms of lower material living standards is quite low. Nevertheless, there are adjustment costs, likely concentrated in particular kinds of activity and therefore felt more strongly in some countries than others. To allow these adjustments to be made as smoothly as possible, early and progressive but decisive action is needed. The range of actions needed (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID1469d592-d6c9-4f20-9aac-758cd755d18c"/>) has been broadly understood for some time. Many of them can be part of policies introduced to spur short-term growth and improve longer-term prospects, such as tax reform, public investment programmes, or action on research and development. Moreover, over the last few years, oil market volatility has led to large and rapid changes in final user prices of petroleum products. Economies have generally adapted to these changes, which are larger than carbon pricing itself would generate in the near future.<fnote id="ID0ece33d5-f0a0-477c-af13-35613844e3b5"><p id="IDc2613825-40a5-412d-95fd-6b8c68467687" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">For example, the additional gasoline tax due to adding a tax of USD 50 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> to existing taxation would be about 44 US cents per gallon, or 11 US cents per litre.</p></fnote> </p><textbox id="ID4df41382-4fc0-4da6-bb28-fcbe734a5d70" contenttype="standard"><boxsection id="ID1469d592-d6c9-4f20-9aac-758cd755d18c" instlang="en" label="Box" number="2.1" numbering="y" reference="Box"><heading><mainhead id="IDff5dcace-2422-448a-9fb3-f57a572f4387">What’s needed: Key policy measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions</mainhead></heading><boxsection id="ID9b7636ea-5d2a-431e-908d-b61a2768ac98" instlang="en" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDabaa2a14-29fb-4217-b4d5-e0f387be1eb8">Pricing greenhouse gases</mainhead></heading><randlist type="bullet"><li id="d1e105" numbering="n"><p id="ID3f2f0670-5472-49a2-a021-3b1b4ae4e5e0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Phase in effective prices on emissions of carbon dioxide and other significant greenhouse gases, including through abolishing fossil fuel subsidies. </p></li><li id="d1e108" numbering="n"><p id="IDaeb16729-a8b4-42a6-b980-9a6a430b7104" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Prices for different gases and sectors should converge through time on a uniform CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent price.</p></li><li id="d1e114" numbering="n"><p id="IDf20953a4-ec50-4e89-b11c-84aed306b153" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The price should apply in public policy decisions as well as for private transactions.</p></li><li id="d1e117" numbering="n"><p id="ID129dd2a4-a553-42ae-9081-9fcc1a09494b" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">It can guide policy even in areas where direct emission pricing is impossible, such as deforestation and agriculture.</p></li></randlist></boxsection><boxsection id="ID3d0fa4a0-c816-433a-b300-10779259424a" instlang="en" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID00b5c40d-1a1d-43a2-93ad-242c835e97b1">Regulation</mainhead></heading><p id="ID709f2226-55e5-45bb-b835-57ed3f7af3b9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">To back up greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing, regulatory measures can be necessary, such as:</p><randlist type="bullet"><li id="d1e127" numbering="n"><p id="IDc037cdd4-a120-4dc0-a5d6-98698a3a723d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">emissions regulation where explicit pricing is infeasible;</p></li><li id="d1e130" numbering="n"><p id="ID0ff9a908-cbf1-4926-b0bf-dc6accc91f00" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">‘nudging’ policies to influence consumer or producer behaviour where information gaps, myopia or habits and inertia inhibit reactions to pricing;

The chapter acknowledges that there are definite economic costs involved – as with any policy reform – but that these are small relative to consequences of such tail events. Next, the chapter notes that some progress has already been made towards the climate change goal, even with somewhat inconsistent policy signals so far. Finally the chapter argues that, far from impeding the current fragile recovery, ambitious measures to set the global economy on a path to zero net greenhouse gas emissions can fit very well within current policy priorities of stimulating investment and technical progress, tax reforms and environmental improvements. These measures need to be part of clear and credible policies, so that individuals and firms fully understand the need for change and plan current and future investment in line with climate change objectives. Addressing climate change policies now and in this way will more likely support than derail global economic growth.</p></section><section id="ID9723f6d2-4b94-4adb-bd70-f7a246accf0f" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDe547c3bc-7eb6-4fff-adc3-d257147fbfd2">Why act?

Although there is some uncertainty about the exact response of average temperature to GHG concentrations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that current trends will lead to an average temperature rise somewhere between 3 and 5°C. </p><p id="ID872b82e8-4e26-4913-b8f8-f217b3f0a13c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">To put this in perspective: "When global warming has happened at various times in the past two million years, it has taken the planet about 5,000 years to warm 5 degrees. The predicted rate of warming for the next century is at least 20 times faster. This rate of change is extremely unusual” (NASA, 2015). This rapid increase will make it difficult, and in some cases impossible, for ecosystems and societies to adapt. Moreover, rapid and irreversible changes, with catastrophic consequences, in at least some regions, seem likely (IPCC, 2014b). Rises in sea levels of several metres due to melting of one or more of the major ice sheets, or disruption to ocean currents that could cause rapid switches in regional climates, are examples of these changes. Natural global climate change at rates lower than current human-related climate change <shortcitation>caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years</shortcitation> (IPCC, 2014b). Current world tensions over migration, water, land and other natural resources illustrate limits to the ability of human societies to easily adjust.</p><p id="IDc2b7a284-2901-42fb-8985-216085681c86" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Climate change will reduce overall disposable incomes partly through some direct effects on productivity in food production, partly through the effects of losses of land through sea-level rise or through increased recurring damage from extreme weather events.

They are especially large in Africa and Asia, where the regional economies are vulnerable to a range of different climate impacts, such as heat stress and crop yield losses. Variation within some regions is likely to be higher than variation across regions.

Probably more significant would be difficult-to-quantify costs from premature death and the social costs of migration and other adaptive behaviour that cannot be captured in GDP.

Much adaptation will take place without any policy action as people and firms adjust to changing circumstances. But it is important to plan for policies to facilitate adaptation, especially where long-lasting investment in public or private infrastructure is concerned. Many countries already have such policy frameworks in place, for example planning construction codes to anticipate sea level rise. There are many other steps that can be taken, such as anticipating the zoning and infrastructure policies that will be needed to moderate the impact of flooding caused by more frequent and severe heavy precipitation events (OECD, 2015e).

The greater certainty of other pricing mechanisms can be partly illusory, however, as tax rates are likely to need adjusting as experience reveals how the economy reacts.

The highest taxes are due to the taxation of energy, especially transport fuel; those taxes mostly pre-date concern about climate change. Expressed in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> content, the taxes vary widely across and between countries. In Germany, for example, which has a strong programme to switch to green energy, the highest tax rates can be ten times higher than the lowest, while some fuels are not taxed at all. A similar pattern can be seen everywhere, even when the different rates are averaged across countries (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDc98f4cc7-e7ae-45f0-92e3-609475bc731e"/>). There are different external costs for different uses of fuels, so there can reasonably be some difference in taxes when expressed only in relation to carbon content. But the degree of variation observed is more than can be justified in that way; it gives distorted incentives. A more efficient tax structure would level out the tax rates, as would a carbon trading system applied uniformly to all emitters. The other main greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, are not subject to direct pricing in any country because specific emissions are hard to monitor and measure.</p><figure id="IDc98f4cc7-e7ae-45f0-92e3-609475bc731e" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" label="Figure" number="2.2" numbering="y" reference="Figure" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="ID3408f375-640b-4de2-b2f2-0d2f56212a8c">The carbon tax<fignoteref refid="IDc0e7ccf6-57b6-4db9-a08f-fe495b66391e" format="fignoteref"/> in OECD and seven partner countries <fignoteref refid="ID7ece2e5b-04d6-4b34-9c50-13e84a3e8424" format="fignoteref"/></figuremainhead></figureheading><graphic id="ID-42-1112257" graphic="CHAP3_FIG2_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><fignote id="IDc0e7ccf6-57b6-4db9-a08f-fe495b66391e" type="number"><p id="ID0688ca21-780c-4f3b-b7d0-bc56e465b772" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Calculated as total indirect taxes on each fuel-use divided by implicit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from combustion.

Some of these policies are only second best, being relatively inefficient compared with a carbon pricing mechanism, although they may have other objectives than reducing GHG emissions; fuel economy standards and certain subsidy programmes are examples (Parry et al., 2014; Fowlie et al., 2015; Ito, 2015).

Where the scope of such uninsurable risks is limited, this has often been addressed through targeted investments in risk reduction. For example, in Australia, a range of specific mitigation investments have been made by the government to reduce the potential for loss in areas severely affected by the 2010-11 Queensland floods. In Germany, a programme has been established to allow households in flood-exposed areas to obtain a flood-resilience certificate, based on an assessment by authorised experts, as a means to secure insurance coverage. However, intervention in the provision of disaster insurance must be carefully designed to ensure that government involvement does not discourage the development of private markets for disaster insurance (see OECD, 2015g).</p><p id="IDc386049f-b141-4220-bf5c-0e1242131141" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">These and other financial innovations could help both to accelerate progress in cutting emissions and to improve the ability of the economy to manage risk through insurance, while also mobilising idle funds.

They could potentially in the future face liability claims similar to those related to asbestos, on the grounds that the companies they had insured had been negligent in emitting greenhouse gases and thereby causing climate change, increasing the probability of weather-related damage (see e.g. Faure and Nollkaemper (2007); Ross et al (2007); Faure and Peters (2011)). Though it is not clear that such litigation would be successful in making insurers liable for damages, the possibility that it might be reinforces the incentive for insurers to find ways to encourage GHG mitigation. The insurance sector has generally been quite vocal in supporting strong action against climate change (see e.g. <hyperlink url="http://www.climate-insurance.org/" target="webpage">http://www.climate-insurance.org</hyperlink>). Insurers are also likely to face higher payouts through time in any case; for example, climate-related supply chain disruption is already an issue for them (Advisen, 2013). Bank of England (2015) surveys climate change issues in insurance from the regulator's point of view.</p><p id="ID4838b46f-2172-473c-be83-d2535caaf761" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Insurance policies usually carry clauses to reduce the risk of accident by invalidating claims, or provide for <shortcitation>deductibles</shortcitation> (reduced compensation) if the policyholder has not taken obvious precautions (specified in the contract). Such clauses work best when the underlying risks are stable. Where the underlying risks are changing, but to an unknown degree, insurance companies, always exposed to normal <shortcitation>tail</shortcitation> risk, can be exposed to a different kind of risk, that of predicting the underlying likelihood of damaging events. When this is too difficult, the private sector may withdraw from providing insurance (Bank of England, 2015). This may be felt as <shortcitation>unfair</shortcitation> though ironically it is good for adaptation: the absence of flood insurance is a strong incentive to avoid building on flood plains. On the other hand, private insurers will generally not handle the risks of nuclear accidents, which are usually taken up by the public sector. </p><p id="ID91f1610f-744f-442c-8370-2001d8170fce" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Although the role of insurance in adaptation can thus be important (OECD, 2015e), insurance can theoretically generate <shortcitation>moral hazard</shortcitation> where the fact of being insured results in people or companies being less vigilant in avoiding risky behaviour. Flood insurance, either private or through public insurance, could have combined with insufficient land-use controls to increase losses due to catastrophic floods in a number of countries in recent years, for example. The use of deductibles can both reduce this risk and give incentives to take action, however. Flood Re, a UK public insurance scheme to which every citizen has to contribute (through household insurance), replacing private insurance, limits this by excluding coverage of houses that were built after 2009 on flood plains. The US National Flood Insurance Program similarly limits the availability of insurance to communities that commit to adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations.</p><p id="ID05711497-5e45-4da7-8f97-0754ef7646dd" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The design of insurance policies can have a positive role to play, although the insurance industry itself may be less dependent on clear and credible climate change policies than other industries, since its existence is due to uncertainty itself. The actual occurrence of individual catastrophic events does not necessarily lead to lower overall supply of insurance. For example. Kramer and Schich (2008) show that following the 20 most costly disasters between 1974 and 2004, where insurance companies saw very large payouts way beyond accumulated premiums, insurance companies' share prices tended to rise relative to the market after an initial fall. Disasters appear to stimulate the demand for insurance, allowing insurers to charge higher premiums, making more profit and attracting new capital. </p><p id="ID56fd4fb1-ccd3-4cbd-a7e2-f64e88852bbd" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">But industrial and commercial companies' insurance risks depend in part on regulatory policy, such as rules on flood plain building or on liability for contributions to climate change, for example. Appropriate and credible regulations in such areas can help to prevent a narrowing of insurance cover and increases in premiums in the face of global warming, so that the insurance sector can improve economies' resilience both by promoting adaptation and by sharing catastrophic losses. </p></section><section id="ID778802cc-1225-4686-aa32-3a2b05029f7e" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID2ce10bbd-e5dd-42c3-b791-ba87ee427176">Greenhouse gas mitigation and the short-term outlook</mainhead></heading><p id="ID774f5ad2-20d8-4dba-a16e-e8d807a47708" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Slow and piecemeal action is costly, not only due to the reduced chances of avoiding climate change, but also because it can affect macroeconomic prospects, particularly when the outlook is fragile as it is now.

Much of this goes on either energy efficiency or renewables, although in some countries nuclear power or fossil fuels take a significant share (a high share for fossil fuels is usually due to carbon capture and storage research). The overall amounts are relatively small, on average total public spending on energy-related RD&amp;D amounts to only around one fifth of the average revenue from environmental taxation.</p><p id="ID8240d3f4-4eaa-42e1-aa3d-9bf0754f274e" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Public support for RD&amp;D is important, because it can be a public good with a number of market failures in its production (for a comprehensive discussion, see Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013).

Investors’ lives are already full of uncertainty, and those related to new technologies and long-lived equipment, as is overwhelmingly the case in climate change, are particularly difficult.

Governments cannot directly reduce the inherent uncertainty in climate change itself, although they can use measures such as subsidies or guaranteed prices to shift the risk away from investors. </p><p id="ID6466dd15-76c7-4a79-ab84-b60e406209f9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Successful climate change policy will reduce the overall level of risk, however, because by reducing the rate of global warming it makes the catastrophic outcomes, whose consequences are particularly difficult to deal with, less likely. High levels of overall risk are likely to depress investment, as firms may prefer to wait rather than make difficult-to-reverse decisions. Some work also shows that higher levels of uncertainty reduce the responsiveness of investment to shocks (Bloom et al, 2007). This might affect the ability of policy to get investment moving again after recessions, for example. </p><p id="ID9437b65a-ff46-48ba-8f10-bc9776836f49" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Policy instability is itself a source of uncertainty for investors and innovators. This is a particular problem for climate change policy, because of the very long-term horizon and the relatively short history of policy engagement on the issue. Climate change policy has indeed suffered from instability in some countries. For example, carbon taxes have been proposed and then removed or watered down (France, Australia), trading systems have been poorly implemented (EU ETS), subsidies to renewables have been at first excessive and then radically reduced in many European countries or have had their conditions frequently modified (Italy, United States). </p><p id="ID4b02b911-e138-468d-80d6-e0ed688601bb" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Policy makers must therefore tread a line between providing long-term assurance that investments made today and today's research and development activity will be profitable many years hence, and preserving the flexibility needed to adjust policies in the light of experience and changing circumstances. Hence, clear and credible policy frameworks can reduce long-term climate risk and shorter-term policy risk, further enhancing the prospects for investment growth. Where credibility is low because of past instability, it cannot be rebuilt rapidly or by ambitious statements of intent alone and there are no clear commitment mechanisms. Policy statements coming from COP21 therefore need to be ambitious, but with a credible level of ambition, and subsequently backed up by steady introduction of the right policy measures. One way to promote such clarity is to ensure that different kinds of policy are consistently directed towards the policy objective (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID8d153f16-07df-4f13-859b-b467f67b4711"/>).

This would seem to be the case in principle with taxation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Here there is room for <shortcitation>nudging</shortcitation> policies, where small amounts of public expenditure can be used to kick-start a reaction; this could be targeted, temporary, subsidies or publicity campaigns, for example. Many countries provide some form of subsidy to energy-saving home improvements, in the face of evidence that householders, and especially owners of rental property, do not make these investments despite their cost-effectiveness. Thus, allocating some climate change revenues to such limited and temporary measures is reasonable, especially from a political economy point of view where it can help to sell the idea of the necessary taxes. Nevertheless, governments should always monitor the impact of these programmes which, despite their good intentions, are not always cost effective (Parry et al., 2014; Fowlie et al,. 2015; Ito, 2015).</p><p id="ID59521865-667b-434f-bb1e-b08c734d6a0b" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Another justification for earmarking can be found in the need to fund investment, especially in RD&amp;D. <shortcitation>Getting the price right</shortcitation> and some <shortcitation>nudging</shortcitation> should give the right incentives for private sector investment but some of the investment needed to reduce GHG emissions will be in the public sector itself, such as better building standards for public buildings. Some could be more indirect, such as investment in low-emission vehicles in public transport or subsidies for initial infrastructure needed for electrically powered road vehicles. Again, such investment, or subsidies to encourage it, might be needed for only a temporary period. Finally, using some revenue from climate change measures to finance RD&amp;D makes sense, since it has an essential role in developing a low-carbon economy. Some RD&amp;D can be targeted on specific groups of technologies or materials and pricing may stimulate this directly, but progress often comes from basic research which is more dependent on untied funding from industry or government. In political economy terms, too, such an allocation can help to make the necessary taxes or charges acceptable. </p></section><section id="ID51ade9e8-d73c-46d5-acd3-f8a53a0b10d7" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID53be86d0-1f5a-4475-8cf2-51ecc1b523d8">The social safety net and energy subsidies</mainhead></heading><p id="ID968d90b8-d6bf-4be4-95ea-2e0a86d37b83" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Many countries use energy subsidies to relieve the burden of high energy prices on particular sections of the population or particular industries.

Ultimately their cost can be many times the actual benefit to the targeted group, unless a complex administrative system is set up to control allocation.</p><p id="ID0896acd9-1209-4132-97e3-36af064e4672" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In countries with effective social safety nets, energy subsidies (whether through sales tax reductions, price controls, or other means) can simply be replaced with appropriate adjustments to social benefits. The situation is more difficult where the country does not have a well-developed system. In this case the waste of subsidising the well-off as well as the poor may be tolerated, but reform is preferable. Setting up an entire welfare system just to replace energy subsidies is unlikely; such reform would have to be part of a larger package. </p><p id="ID579d4051-2d09-480c-abc3-af5abf872d13" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Reforms can take advantage of favourable opportunities. For example, Indonesia recently took advantage of lower energy prices to reduce energy subsidies to households at a time when their loss for poorer people was offset by falling market prices. At the same time an income support scheme was introduced, which should deliver better targeted poverty alleviation. The income support scheme in Indonesia may in practice be temporary, and most of the savings have been allocated to such programmes as infrastructure investment or education. IMF (2013) identifies targeted mitigating measures as an element in the success of 18 out of 28 reform episodes. No country where fossil fuel subsidies have been important has successfully abolished the full range of these subsidies, which should remain a long-term policy priority (OECD, 2015h).</p></section></section><section id="ID6a124390-3d7f-4fba-a9ef-b8d3f68ec4f2" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID9fcb1628-9b80-442a-a2dd-77dd34f5ef11">Conclusion</mainhead></heading><p id="IDbdd5076b-17ca-4674-8239-f78158bacbdb" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">COP21 could be an important step on the road to the zero-carbon economy that is needed to give the world a chance of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change. A clear commitment to a zero-carbon path, along with credible policy programmes across the world to meet that target, would usher in an era of radical change in energy supply and industrial structure. Major investment commitments by both public and private sectors would be needed. While these would be costly, this chapter has argued that there are many reasons to suppose that both the direct effects of increased investment and the indirect effects of reduced risks and gains in confidence will support rather than hinder the recovery.</p></section><biblio id="d1e605" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDa77c0deb-3f2c-454c-8a5a-e50b194dc147">Bibliography</mainhead></heading><p id="IDa72fd584-89fe-40e8-8dc3-612687cc0442" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Advisen (2013), <shortcitation>The Vulnerability of Global Supply Chains: The Importance of Resiliency in the Face of Systemic Risk</shortcitation>, <emphasis emph="italic">Advisen Insurance Intelligence White Paper</emphasis>, July.</p><p id="ID908b365c-0b92-4a2b-902e-a478e49a8094" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Albrizio, S., E.

However, the mechanism’s parameters, particularly the baseline emissions, may require tightening following the planned 2017-18 review if emission-reduction goals for 2030 are to be achieved. </p></section><section id="ID69bfd920-9151-4392-a016-c890cad86bac" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID298d20db-31c3-4044-b19c-873b24d32b72">Output growth will pick up, but external uncertainties dominate the risk profile </mainhead></heading><p id="ID8a0b0fad-2b6d-4169-a8c3-c46f186bba78" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Output growth is expected be 2.2% for 2015 but rise to 3% in 2017.

Similarly, stronger or weaker growth in emerging market economies, in particular in China, as well as geopolitical tensions would affect export growth and, hence, the pace of the recovery in Austria. The restructuring of the banking sector is ongoing. If associated uncertainties explain more of the current sluggishness of investment and consumer confidence than assumed, growth may prove more subdued than projected.

Improving the targeting of social benefits by shifting the focus of spending increases towards conditional cash transfers could accelerate the decline of inequality and make social spending more efficient. </p></section><section id="ID0067996d-7f09-4ad7-af17-55a7b8129d42" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDe3b9dbb9-2a8b-4abe-9266-b95cf0a705cc">The economy is set for a gradual recovery </mainhead></heading><p id="IDcb5c794d-91fc-4717-819a-30b38b63efa0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">GDP is projected to contract again in 2016, but, once fiscal results improve and inflation recedes, recovering confidence will support stronger investment and consumption going into 2017.</p><p id="ID0def72f2-d34e-474d-b215-674fa20e9793" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">If the fiscal adjustment plans are effectively implemented as announced and coupled with progress on the structural reform agenda, the ensuing confidence boost could be more powerful than expected.

Confidence could also suffer if monetary policy fails to deliver significant reductions in inflation. Fallout from the events unfolding at Petrobras and alleged corruption cases could be stronger than expected in the event of further cancellations of planned investment projects, or if the investigations lead to further bankruptcies in upstream activities, including in the construction sector. Volatility on international capital markets could return in the context of monetary policy normalisation in the United States, but Brazil’s high foreign currency reserves of USD 361 billion (25% of GDP) provide a strong cushion. Further currency depreciation could imply difficulties for corporate borrowers, even if a significant fraction of corporate debt is hedged against currency risks. A further slowdown of growth in China, the export destination for many of Brazil’s commodity exports, could also reduce growth in Brazil. </p></section></section><section id="IDa28c4294-841d-4510-930a-0f36752e7a31" content="indicator" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDa61d7712-a003-4d83-a1be-9a63137e90ec">Canada</mainhead></heading><p id="ID146287ed-c922-4a67-ad3b-1897cba01fc8" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"><emphasis emph="bold">Economic growth is projected to recover in 2016, and reach 2.3% in 2017.

Raising tax efficiency by relying more on environmentally-related taxes would help achieve greener growth – Canada has one of the lowest tax rates on carbon dioxide emissions from energy use in the OECD. British Columbia introduced its own carbon tax and has seen a significant reduction in related fuel sales. To make growth more inclusive, the incoming federal government has undertaken to increase income tax rates on high earners to finance cuts for middle income earners and to terminate income splitting. It should reduce the Small Business Deduction, which mainly benefits high-income households and reduces productivity, instead of increasing it, as planned. Increasing targeted needs-based financial assistance in tertiary education and expanding public core health insurance coverage to include essential pharmaceuticals would also make growth more inclusive.

Expectation of further renminbi depreciation triggered capital outflows and prompted the authorities to step in to defend the currency, resulting in a sharp decline in foreign exchange reserves. The authorities also imposed reserves for currency derivatives. Further measures, including more rigorous monitoring of foreign exchange purchases by businesses and individuals and a crackdown on illegal foreign exchange transactions, curbed capital outflows and limited the decline in reserves. Narrowing of the interest differential and slowing growth, however, may lead to further capital outflows and pressure on the exchange rate. </p><p id="IDa53034f1-68d3-4fce-858f-25bf1d237b76" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Fiscal policy is being loosened, with a 2.4% of GDP headline deficit target (3.1% accounting for carry-over and debt-swaps) for 2015, up from 1.8% in 2014. (In terms of a broader definition of the budget adding up all four budget accounts, the deficit is set to increase from 0.3% of GDP in 2014 to 1% in 2015.) Large infrastructure projects are being implemented, including in railways, water and environmental protection, where ample needs remain. Overall, based on measures that have been announced, fiscal stimulus is assumed to amount to around 1½ per cent of GDP in 2015, ½ per cent in 2016 and ¼ per cent in 2017. Local government investment vehicles, which had transferred part of their debt to subnational governments, have been allowed to borrow again, which may lead to another round of implicit government debt accumulation. The cut in the vehicle purchase tax from 10% to 5% until end-2016 will support consumer spending. In addition, the new fund for public-private financing of projects is expected to boost private investment in infrastructure and thus to support urbanisation.</p></section><section id="ID2706b4a8-98a3-4f42-97ef-36ec509df840" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID0c3b2f66-6cb6-45af-b215-e1300ba596d8">Large-scale stimulus may delay re-balancing </mainhead></heading><p id="IDf01c1a1b-f7db-4a84-ad2c-b8fedbddc7bc" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The fiscal stimulus will help the economy approach the growth target of <shortcitation>around 7%</shortcitation> in 2015.

Likewise, raising loan-to-value ratios further would support house sales now, but at the cost of prolonging price adjustment. Either way, deleveraging would be delayed. Faster adjustment in industries affected by overcapacity, in contrast, would further slow investment in the short term but would reduce imbalances. Shrinking corporate profits as a result of deepening producer price deflation could increase the share of bad loans on bank balance sheets. A weaker currency could boost exports temporarily, but competitiveness pressures need to be addressed by lasting measures such as further reducing the costs of doing business, accelerating efficiency-enhancing reforms of state-owned enterprises and opening up more industries to private investment. Furthermore, stepping up structural reforms to boost rural incomes and to extend the social safety net would stimulate spending and could also provide a boost to growth and give new impetus to re-balancing. Greater spending power at the lower end of the income distribution would also make growth more inclusive.</p></section></section><section id="IDfa20a857-782c-4ae6-a274-220928dffa03" content="indicator" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDc8c19bc4-e8e7-42e7-992d-5da9d5d261ef">Colombia</mainhead></heading><p id="ID8724b862-dbea-447b-bca1-45b4cde71740" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"><emphasis emph="bold">Economic growth slowed in 2015 due to the fall in commodity prices, but is projected to gradually recover in 2016 and 2017 with investment and non-oil exports recovering.

The programme of structural reforms could raise confidence more than assumed, boosting business investment. Additional declines in oil prices would also raise growth. The household saving rate remains high, allowing for a potential boost to private consumption once the turnaround takes hold. On the other hand, if structural reforms are poorly communicated or weakly implemented, or if measures to reduce the tax burden are not sufficient, confidence could fall and the recovery could stall. Heightened uncertainties about euro-area prospects and a stronger-than-projected slowdown in key emerging markets (notably China) would also lower external demand. In addition, the impact of still low business profitability, housing market contraction and policy uncertainty could linger, and a higher-than-assumed exchange rate and oil prices would weigh on activity.</p></section></section><section id="ID1f0c88ac-21cc-4bb8-b68c-ccef1e81a899" content="indicator" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="IDaf8878cb-82d4-4e9e-9485-778c9cfe93ec">Germany</mainhead></heading><p id="ID4ef38364-f34a-40d3-ac22-84797a5b8187" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"><emphasis emph="bold">Economic growth is projected to strengthen in 2016, as a robust labour market, low interest rates and low oil prices underpin private consumption.

Low oil prices damped consumer prices while a tight labour market pushed up wages. Employment has continued to grow and the unemployment rate, already the lowest in the European Union, has fallen further. However, the pay gap between women and men remains large, reflecting barriers for women to develop their professional activities. The national minimum wage has added about ½ percentage point to wage growth, but there appear to have been no job losses. Demand for housing continues to rise, pushing up housing rents and prices in urban centers, but also spurring construction. Business investment is strengthening only slowly, notwithstanding historically low long-term interest rates and high profitability. Investment remains particularly subdued in energy-intensive manufacturing sectors. Extensive energy tax reductions and uncertainty about future regulatory changes are likely to hold back energy-saving investment in these sectors.

Exports continue to gain market share, benefitting from past depreciation, expanded production capacity in the automotive sector, and the integration of major exporters into the supply chains of German firms. </p><figure id="IDe2c4d1c9-7eff-457d-960b-a06823482796" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" numbering="n" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="IDf94de02c-076a-46e7-95e3-24b581c0149d">Hungary</figuremainhead></figureheading><graphic id="ID-42-1119483" graphic="CHAP2_HUN_FIG1_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><source type="sing"><p id="ID19d31603-b2a6-487e-9dfe-b7054e0e0e88" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD, Main Economic Indicators database.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933296253" target="statlink"/></figure><p id="ID8a66c6bd-5cfc-4b11-a469-7adbffb0a519" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Employment growth is increasingly being underpinned by higher private labour demand, although an expansion of public work schemes continues to contribute to the fall in unemployment. The public work schemes hold the promise of making growth more inclusive, but need to be reconfigured to better address the labour market prospects of vulnerable groups, such as the Roma people and those with low educational attainment. Younger women have a low labour participation rate, and while the promotion of flexible work arrangements is a step in the right direction, more probably needs to be done. So far, wage growth has remained subdued. Real wages were boosted by falling energy prices that induced deflation although this is expected to end in late 2015.

Conversely, monetary policy remains very accommodative. During the first half of 2015, the central bank lowered its policy rate five times, by a cumulated 75 basis points, to 1.35%.

Further measures to strengthen the quality of banks’ portfolios include the purchasing of bad commercial real estate loans and properties from banks and a gradual reduction of the levy on financial institutions’ balance sheets. In addition, the government is introducing a voluntary conversion of households’ foreign-currency denominated consumption loans and lowering the bank levy. These measures should spur lending and allow the central bank to wind up the Funding for Growth schemes by end-2016. Nonetheless, non-performing loans remain high. Demand for credit for investment purposes in the non-tradable sectors could be stimulated by securing a more stable regulatory framework that focusses on promoting competition in these sectors. Reforms to improve the labour market prospects of Roma people, the low-skilled and younger women would bolster the inclusiveness of economic growth. </p></section><section id="IDa36802a3-6a0d-47af-b109-00cbf72ae8d5" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID1e6538d7-b8e0-498c-8044-9982e30a1b75">Growth is expected to ease</mainhead></heading><p id="IDca1be4ff-21d7-4d8a-9ce7-17637bdabb57" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In 2016, economic growth is projected to slow significantly as public investment contracts, reflecting lower disbursement of EU structural funds at the beginning of a new funding cycle.

Low levels of consumer confidence are weighing on private consumption, and, while government consumption has picked up, it remains soft. An expected pick-up in investment has not yet materialised as infrastructure spending remains bogged down by implementation bottlenecks and private investment is being held back by lower commodity prices and impaired business confidence. Notwithstanding significant currency depreciation, partly due to lower commodity prices, export growth has been very weak on the back of stagnant foreign demand. While weakening growth and lower commodity prices have seen the currency depreciate significantly over the past 18 months, the currency has recently rebounded somewhat on the back of profit-taking. However, the currency remains significantly below the levels of one year ago, and notwithstanding this export growth has been very weak due to stagnant foreign demand. Moreover, despite softer foreign demand, slowing domestic spending and improved terms of trade contributed to a rapid shrinking of the current account deficit.</p><figure id="ID11532f68-d8bf-4b16-80c2-8a18305f0eb4" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" numbering="n" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="IDaa957d01-f982-481b-8c78-874d246f8ccf">Indonesia</figuremainhead></figureheading><graphic id="ID-42-1121000" graphic="CHAP2_IDN_FIG1_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><source type="sing"><p id="IDd30a5242-57d9-4f01-a1ed-668d57e73e02" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Statistics Indonesia (BPS); OECD Economic Outlook 98 database; and Bank Indonesia.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933296294" target="statlink"/></figure><p id="ID120d5d12-75b5-4e9d-8c0f-866d03860a58" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"> While the impact on inflation of the removal of fuel subsidies at the beginning of 2015 has abated and lower world energy prices have exerted downward pressure on prices, food prices and the depreciating exchange rate have both kept inflation high.

The improving labour market is bolstering consumer and business confidence and – along with subdued commodity and energy prices – households' purchasing power and private consumption.</p><figure id="ID3651fdd1-706b-4245-b579-f82f66d17ae7" instlang="en" float="y" type="figure" numbering="n" orient="port"><figureheading><figuremainhead id="IDd45dea2e-5ec7-4229-9f1d-470f2fb32a09">Italy</figuremainhead></figureheading><graphic id="ID-42-1122383" graphic="CHAP2_ITA_FIG1_E_P2CS.p1" type="graphic"/><source type="sing"><p id="ID078864f9-fb46-4168-9ee2-a1f2e326dfd9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD Economic Outlook 98 database.</p></source><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933296323" target="statlink"/></figure><p id="ID2fdf2f37-87a9-4e2f-8e75-809002e5fb6a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Investment has been tentative, owing to still large spare capacity, restricted credit supply, and weak public investment.

Diesel should also be more taxed than gasoline to reflect higher carbon emissions per litre (and higher emmissions of other pollutants). </p><tablegrp id="ID276fa016-3122-4fba-b8ba-ce39140169d3" instlang="en" numbering="n"><tableheading><tablemainhead id="tab-0000157"><emphasis emph="normal">United Kingdom:</emphasis> Demand and output</tablemainhead></tableheading><graphic id="ID-42-1134970" graphic="CHAP2_GBR_TAB3_E.p1" type="graphic"/><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933296906" target="statlink"/></tablegrp><p id="ID168958af-d49a-4e07-b804-70aa238e0e53" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Spare capacity is low and a gradual normalisation in interest rates, with the first hike in early 2016, would be prudent to contain excess demand pressures that now seem to be developing. Yet, since consumer price inflation has been very low and expectations are well anchored, the pace of monetary adjustment should be gradual. Higher interest rates should encourage greater economic restructuring thereby supporting productivity, which stronger infrastructure investment would further boost. Releasing more land for housing, as considered by the authorities in a recent Productivity Plan, would also support productivity by improving labour mobility and reducing skills mismatches. </p><tablegrp id="ID2752ecf9-f4e3-4964-9a2b-ff11e1594f4f" instlang="en" numbering="n"><tableheading><tablemainhead id="tab-0000158"><emphasis emph="normal">United Kingdom:</emphasis> External indicators</tablemainhead></tableheading><graphic id="ID-42-1135180" graphic="CHAP2_GBR_TAB4_E.p1" type="graphic"/><hyperlink url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888933296915" target="statlink"/></tablegrp></section><section id="IDe587d5dc-5be1-43fb-bc36-f087551ba7a4" content="default" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID9d62633a-d45b-4d00-94da-928c6cf3b037">Growth will moderate somewhat</mainhead></heading><p id="ID8722f34b-0d47-48cc-975e-f9be385f1375" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">GDP growth is expected to continue at a solid pace, with private domestic demand remaining a key driver.

House price buoyancy could restrict access to the rental market, reducing labour mobility, and boost household indebtedness, creating financial stability risks. Stronger growth in the euro area would boost exports and further narrow the current account deficit, but could be offset by weaker external demand from China and other emerging markets.</p></section></section><section id="IDc3c96e31-34d3-43b6-9377-b923226131cc" content="indicator" geocontainer="false" statisticalannex="false" numbering="n"><heading><mainhead id="ID26a1db5a-30f9-4c12-a1d7-291cc831e3d2">United States</mainhead></heading><p id="IDeddcf8d9-d830-4eb3-b098-34ed4d621e8e" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"><emphasis emph="bold">Output remains on a solid growth trajectory, propelled by household demand.

Although the recent deceleration of healthcare spending has made consolidation less urgent, debt remains high by historical standards and could constrain policy responses to future adverse shocks.
