					Different this Time?</mainhead>
			</heading>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0001" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The
				global economy is, once again, trying to return to growth, helped by a modest
				pick-up of trade and an improvement in confidence. It is doing so, however, at
				different speeds, with the United States and Japan growing at a stronger pace than
				the euro area and large emerging economies enjoying a moderate cyclical upswing.
				Different dynamics are also developing in labour markets in the United States, where
				unemployment is slowly decreasing, and in the euro area, where instead it keeps
				rising.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the
					<emphasis emph="italic">United States</emphasis>, growth should continue to
				strengthen as confidence is picking up in both businesses and households. Financial
				markets are firming and household deleveraging is well underway which should allow
				saving rates to ease. More generally, growth seems to be increasingly driven by
				private‐sector demand rather than by policy. Fiscal consolidation is dragging
				growth, but only at a moderate pace. However, the risk of excessive fiscal
				tightening in 2013 remains to be addressed, failing which, growth would be severely
				affected. Looking forward, long-term fiscal sustainability remains to be achieved,
				and a credible fiscal plan is needed to ensure it. Given the still weak recovery and
				sluggish job creation, monetary policy should remain accommodative, but conditional
				upon activity developments.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0003" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In
					<emphasis emph="italic">Japan</emphasis>, the very high sovereign debt requires
				the establishment of a more detailed and credible consolidation programme to put
				debt firmly on a downward path, and structural reforms are needed to boost
				growth.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0004" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In most
					<emphasis emph="italic">emerging economies</emphasis>, activity remains strong
				but policy challenges are different across countries as inflation acts as a drag on
				real incomes in some, while it remains subdued in others. Where available, lower
				inflation provides policy space that could be used to sustain activity. In many
				emerging countries there are renewed risks of asset price bubbles, also related to
				capital inflows. Prudential and fiscal policies should deal with such risks.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0005" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">More
				generally, while international financial integration enhances efficiency and boosts
				growth, it may increase financial fragility. OECD research shows that very limited
				progress has been achieved since 2007 in making the structure of external financial
				accounts more robust, and this could be a source of adverse risk going forward.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0006" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Global
				imbalances are likely to remain at current levels for some time, but with important
				changes in geographical composition. Oil producers’ surpluses are increasing, while
				surpluses in Japan and China are slightly declining, reflecting, especially in the
				latter case, a welcome strengthening of domestic demand.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0007" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">After
				some retrenchment at the end of last year, the crisis in the <emphasis emph="italic"
					>euro area</emphasis> has become more serious recently, and it remains the most
				important source of risk to the global economy. Confidence remains weak or is even
				declining, financial markets are again volatile, and deleveraging has barely begun.
				Fiscal drag on growth from consolidation may be significant, especially in some
				countries.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0008" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Such
				persistent weakness reflects underlying economic, fiscal, and financial imbalances
				within the euro area, which have been the root cause of the crisis, and have barely
				begun to unwind. Recovery in healthier countries, while welcome, is not strong
				enough to offset flat or negative growth elsewhere. Weak competitiveness must be
				addressed in deficit countries, while structural adjustment and higher wages in
				surplus countries would contribute to a growth-friendly rebalancing process.
				Adjustment is underway; however, it is taking place in an environment of slow or
				negative growth and deleveraging. Against this background the risk is increasing of
				a vicious circle, involving high and rising sovereign indebtedness, weak banking
				systems, excessive fiscal consolidation and lower growth.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0009" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Recent
				events have further increased downside risks. Elections in a number of euro area
				countries have signalled that reform fatigue is increasing and tolerance for fiscal
				adjustment may be reaching a limit. With the expectation of euro area with no growth
				in 2012, but with recession in a number of countries in 2012 and 2013, a combination
				of enduring financial fragility, rising unemployment and social pain may spark
				political contagion and adverse market reaction. Dramatic developments in individual
				countries would accelerate the process. A downside scenario, like the one described
				in the previous <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>, may materialise
				and spill over outside the euro area with very serious consequences for the global
				economy. Avoiding such a scenario requires action to be taken both at country and
				supranational level.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0010" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Fiscal
				consolidation and structural measures must proceed hand in hand to make the process
				as growth‐friendly as possible. The composition of fiscal consolidation, with a
				careful balance between spending cuts and revenue increases, is critically
				important. In addition, much can be gained in efficiency of public spending and
				through a composition of taxation that is least harmful to growth. Importantly, the
				reform agenda must be targeted at supporting employment through both labour and
				product market reforms. Last but not least, resources should be devoted to support
				the weakest segments of the population and mitigate the pressure of
				consolidation.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">While
				trying to improve the quality of fiscal consolidation is of the essence, the speed
				of consolidation should depend on country-specific circumstances. While for some
				countries there is no alternative but for consolidation to keep its course, for
				others there is scope for easing the pace. In general, should unforeseen
				circumstances lead to a further slowdown in activity, the additional structural
				consolidation needed to attain deficit goals should be implemented only
				partially.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0012" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"
				>Credible medium-term consolidation programmes are a key prerequisite for successful
				adjustment. However, in the current circumstances, when several countries are
				undergoing fiscal tightening, credibility and confidence would be enhanced by euro
				area and EU-wide measures.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0013" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In this
				respect much progress has been achieved in recent months. The euro area firewall has
				been enhanced. IMF resources have been increased, and the LTROs activated by the ECB
				have injected confidence. However, the effectiveness of the firewall can be further
				enhanced, for instance by allowing ESM resources to be used directly to meet bank
				recapitalisation needs. Also, the operational conditions of firewall resources
				should be improved to provide quick deployment if needed. Were instability and
				volatility in sovereign markets to increase, the ECB should resume and expand its
				SMP. Last but not least, given declining inflationary pressures, there is room for
				further monetary easing.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0014" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The
					<shortcitation>fiscal compact</shortcitation> has introduced a stronger
				framework for fiscal discipline. It could be further improved to allow for more
				selective assessment of spending items in computing debt reduction obligations. In
				the new regime, a number of fiscal rules will be in force at the same time, so it
				will be important to ensure transparency in the communication of the fiscal position
				to avoid unjustified market reactions to inaccurate interpretation of the adjustment
				efforts. Ultimately, it is important to implement the new framework in a balanced
				way, ensuring that remaining discretion is used only if appropriate.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0015" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Firm
				fiscal discipline and successful consolidation provide the background conditions for
				additional measures towards the establishment of a <shortcitation>growth
					compact</shortcitation>. Such measures could include: <emphasis emph="italic"
					>i)</emphasis> issuance of new jointly guaranteed government bonds to help
				recapitalise banks and enhance credit availability; <emphasis emph="italic"
					>ii)</emphasis> increasing jointly guaranteed resources available for the
				European Investment Bank to fund infrastructure projects; <emphasis emph="italic"
					>iii)</emphasis> such moves could pave the way to a broader issuance of
				euro-bonds; <emphasis emph="italic">iv)</emphasis> redirecting available structural
				fund resources toward more growth enhancing allocations; and <emphasis emph="italic"
					>v)</emphasis> a decisive acceleration of single market integration promises to
				be a major source of growth.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0016" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Such
				set of EU-wide measures would strengthen activity, both directly and indirectly, by
				boosting confidence and making it easier to achieve the intra euro area rebalancing
				effort. At national level deficit countries should enhance competitiveness by
				improving the functioning of their labour and product markets, and surplus countries
				could enhance investment through liberalisation measures notably in the service
				sectors. A further boost to confidence could be obtained if euro area countries were
				to announce and commit to implement such reforms in a coordinated and parallel
				fashion, signalling enhanced coordination. Higher nominal wages in surplus
				countries, while boosting domestic demand, could contribute to a less painful
				readjustment in deficit countries where wage deflation adds to the pressure of
				increasing unemployment.</p>
			<p id="o12-2012-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0017" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Almost
				five years ago, in the summer of 2007, turbulence in the US subprime market sparked
				off the most dramatic financial and economic crisis in several decades. After five
				years we cannot yet say that the crisis is behind us. More than once signs of
				recovery have disappointed. Policy mistakes have been made, sometimes reflecting
				inaccurate reading of events, at other times reflecting policy and political
				failures. Is it different this time? As long as confidence is not rebuilt on a solid
				basis with the right policy choices, downside risks will prevail. This is important
				everywhere but particularly so in the euro area, where crisis management goes hand
				in hand with the building of the institutions needed for a monetary union to work
				properly.</p>

						than six months ago, with the immediate downside risks in the euro area
						associated with sovereign defaults and systemic bank failures having been
						contained so far by policy actions. These have improved confidence and
						financial conditions, but clear fragilities remain. The breathing space
						created needs to be used to bolster confidence that the economic adjustment
						required to durably solve the underlying solvency problems and imbalances at
						the root of the euro area crisis will be forthcoming. In a number of other
						OECD economies, the post-crisis healing process is advancing gradually. This
						is the case particularly in the United States, where it is helped by the
						avoidance of excessive fiscal consolidation this year and hopefully next. In
						the emerging economies, a gradual cyclical upswing is now getting underway,
						supported by moves to ease domestic monetary conditions now that inflation
						has eased.</p>

						and particularly strong fiscal headwinds in the countries under market
						pressure (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table"

								comparatively subdued, particularly in the euro area and the United

								real disposable incomes, which are being constrained by labour
								market slack (see below), high oil prices and ongoing fiscal
								consolidation. Soft consumer confidence, even after recent
								improvements, and tighter constraints on bank loans may also
								moderate consumption growth in the near term. In the United States,
								additional balance sheet adjustment is likely to be required, but
								with household debt deleveraging much further advanced than
								elsewhere, a higher saving rate will not be required to ensure
								adjustment. With improved job creation reducing the need for
								precautionary saving, the US saving ratio is projected to be close
								to 4% in 2013, around ½ percentage point lower than in 2011-12. The
								saving ratio is projected to be broadly flat through the projection

								rates and financial innovation, in the context of inadequate
								regulation. The latter provided increased scope for regulatory
								arbitrage and excessive risk-taking by financial institutions,
								especially those regarded as being too big to fail (Blundell-Wignall
								and Atkinson, 2011; Slovik, 2012), and amplified feed-back loops
								between higher household debt and higher property prices. In many

								in the run-up to the crisis can probably be regarded as being
									<shortcitation>excessive.</shortcitation> Questions that are

								before the crisis, the United Kingdom and the United States have
								seen significant reductions in household debt, cutting household
								debt-to-income ratios by close to 20 percentage points since 2007
								(see table below). In the United States, the debt ratio of the
								financial sector has fallen below the level in 2007, partly because
								of write-offs related to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and
								consolidation in the banking sector. In the United Kingdom, the
								ratio of non-financial corporate debt to GDP has declined moderately
								since 2007 but remains well above its 2000 level, while debt in the
								financial sector has continued to increase relative to GDP. The
								debt-reduction process has barely begun in other large countries
								that experienced a credit boom over the past decade and in some,
								debt is still rising relative to GDP.</p>

								numbering="y">Using the increase in debt ratios from their pre-boom
								levels in 2000 as a simple indicator of the risk of potential
								deleveraging pressures, three groups of countries can be
								distinguished: (i) no reduction in indebtedness appears to be likely
								in Japan and Germany; (ii) following considerable debt reduction, a
								mild further reduction in indebtedness might occur in the United
								States; (iii) significant cuts in indebtedness risk taking place in
								many other countries, though it bears mention that recent run-ups in
								debt occurred from low levels in some (including France, Belgium and
								Italy) and have generally been accompanied by increases in the net
								worth of households.</p>

								economic consequences though these will differ depending on the
								current pace of debt reduction, the time period over which debt is
								to be reduced and the debt reduction strategies adopted. In the
								United States, should deleveraging continue at its pace over the
								past four years, with continued significant write-downs of household
								debt, the debt ratio would regain its 2000 level in 2015. For
								households in the United Kingdom, at the adjustment speed observed
								since 2008, the adjustment period would be longer, at around ten
								years, reflecting the larger debt overhang. In both countries, the
								major headwinds associated with deleveraging, namely the increase in
								saving rates and reduction in residential investment, are, however,
								likely behind them (though falling saving rates and rising
								residential investment may contribute less to the recovery than is
								usual).</p>

								is a negative risk to growth.</p>

								debt-reduction strategies, household debt write-downs or defaults
								may mitigate the negative effects of deleveraging on economic
								activity by redistributing losses from debtors with a high
								propensity to consume to creditors with a lower propensity. Such an
								adjustment is relatively easy to initiate at a comparatively low
								cost by debtors in the United States because of the non-recourse
								nature of mortgage loans but is more costly elsewhere in the OECD
								because of the unlimited liability of households as borrowers.
								However, large-scale household defaults could risk destabilising the
								financial system if additional private capital injections were not
								available, requiring public capital injections to safeguard the
								banking system. While this might simply transform a household debt
								problem into a public debt one, the economic costs may still be
								lower than keeping household spending compressed for long periods to
								honour debt obligations.</p>
							<p id="OCDEid1269029" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The
								restructuring of household debt, including debt forgiveness to write
								down debt to a certain percentage of disposable income or the value
								of the underlying collateral, could also raise the average
								propensity to spend and, by reducing foreclosures, would also lower
								the social cost of home eviction and prevent fire-sales of
								repossessed property. Several OECD countries have public programmes
								that provide subsidies for household debt restructuring and
								discussions are on-going in some to increase such support. For
								example, in the United States, discussions centre on how the
								government-sponsored agencies, Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae, as owners
								and guarantors of mortgages, could reduce the extent of mortgages

						only slowly in the United States and the euro area, with recent increases in
						oil prices and, in Europe, administered prices and indirect taxes, partially
						offsetting favourable base effects. The oil price increase since the start
						of 2012 will likely add a little under ¼ percentage point to headline
						inflation in the OECD economies this year, and a little more in the emerging
						market economies, given the relatively energy-intensive nature of production
						in these economies. The assumed slight upward drift in oil prices will serve
						to keep headline inflation rates marginally above core inflation rates
						through the projection period. However, with long-term inflation
						expectations in the OECD economies, especially survey-based measures,
						remaining reasonably well anchored, substantial spare capacity in many OECD
						economies should bear down on price inflation through much of the projection
						period (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure"
							refid="o12-2012-01-1-P00-c01-s04-06-g009"/>). Core inflation is set to
						remain relatively sticky in the United States, dropping only to around 1¾
						per cent, with unit labour costs continuing to rise by between 2¼-2¾ per
						cent per annum as the labour market firms. In the euro area, where the
						output gap seems likely to widen through most of the projection period,
						disinflationary pressures are likely to be stronger, notwithstanding the
						impact of further increases in indirect taxes in France and Italy, and core
						inflation could eventually drift down to a little below 1½ per cent. In
						Japan, deflation is expected to diminish gradually over the projection
						period. In the major emerging market economies, a period of below-trend
						growth has alleviated underlying inflationary tensions arising from past
						capacity pressures, and the likely cyclical upturn is not projected to be at
						a pace that would raise core inflation significantly, although the effect of
						higher commodity prices will be seen in headline inflation.</p>

								numbering="y">In the United States, the sizable recent fall in
								unemployment is puzzling, given output growth at or below trend. One
								possibility is that this simply reflects a one-off readjustment
								aligning employment more closely with production, with strong
								rehiring of workers being the counterpart to the exceptionally rapid
								declines in employment during the recession (Bernanke, 2012; <xref
									object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box"
									refid="o12-2012-01-1-P00-c01-bs03"/>). An alternative
								possibility is that unexpectedly robust employment growth could
								persist; in particular, the average private sector workweek has
								recently returned to pre-crisis levels, and thus it is likely that a
								greater proportion of rising labour demand may now be met by
								increases in employment rather than in hours worked.<fnote

										indent="y" numbering="y">A third possibility is that GDP
										growth has been under-estimated in recent quarters.</p>
								</fnote> Additional uncertainties arise regarding the participation
								rate, which has continued to decline even as hiring has picked up. A
								pro-cyclical upturn in the labour participation rate would normally
								be expected to constrain the speed at which improved employment
								outcomes lowered the unemployment rate. However, a considerable part
								of the recent fall in the aggregate participation rate may not be
								reversed as it reflects ongoing demographic change, with a rising
								share of over 55-year olds in the working-age population and a
								declining share of the prime-age 25-54 year olds, the cohort with
								the highest participation rate (Aaronson <emphasis emph="italic">et
									al</emphasis>., 2012). Thus it is possible that higher
								employment growth may result in more rapid declines in the
								unemployment rate than would normally be expected. In the
								projection, greater weight is placed on the one-off readjustment
								story, with employment growth expected to average a little over
								1¾ per cent per annum in 2012-13, well below the growth rates
								observed since last autumn. With the increase in the labour force
								held down in 2013 by the assumed termination of the extended
								entitlement to unemployment benefit, this employment growth will
								still enable the unemployment rate to decline by a further ½-¾
								percentage point over the projection period.</p>

						in those countries in which sizable fiscal consolidation is being undertaken
						(OECD, 2012a). Labour market reforms remain essential to foster near-term
						employment growth and reduce the risk that higher unemployment becomes
						permanently entrenched. In a context of ongoing fiscal consolidation, hiring
						incentives can be raised by reforms that include: strengthening public
						employment services and training programmes to improve the matching of
						workers and jobs, which may require that such expenditures be sheltered from
						fiscal consolidation efforts; growth-friendly tax reforms to shift the tax
						burden towards tax bases that are less harmful for job creation, such as
						property and consumption taxes; and temporary reductions in labour taxation,
						where feasible through well-targeted marginal job subsidies (for new hires
						where net jobs are rising) rather than via across-the-board reductions in
						payroll taxes.<fnote id="o12-2012-01-1-P00-c01-s04-11-n08">

						labour market downturn could also be cushioned by broader use of
						work-sharing arrangements and maintaining the resources necessary to help
						fund short-time working schemes. In this context it will be important to
						build in incentives so that schemes focus on protecting long-term viable
						jobs. Product market reforms to relax regulatory restrictions in sectors in
						which there is a strong potential for new job growth, such as retail trade
						and professional services, could also serve to improve labour market
						outcomes relatively quickly. Other structural measures that might help to
						improve long-term labour market outcomes, such as rebalancing employment
						protection towards less-strict protection for regular workers, but more
						protection for temporary workers, and reductions in unemployment benefit
						duration, may be less effective when labour demand is particularly weak. and
						should be pursued in the current context only when existing policy settings

								This risks giving rise to policy upheavals with adverse long-term,

								long-run living standards include: facilitating the accumulation of

						be as short-lived as assumed. In the event of a funding shortfall, further
						increases in the scale of the EFSF/ESM funds would involve even more direct
						pressure on the fiscal positions of those countries that provide capital to

						numbering="y">A further issue is that satisfying financing needs in primary
						markets may not suffice to prevent turbulence in the secondary government
						bond markets, with potential repercussions for the stability of the banking
						system. The loss-absorbing capacity of European banks has been strengthened
						by increasing their minimum Tier-one capital to 9% of risk-weighted assets
						by mid-2012, which banks are in the process of achieving through measures
						such as raising capital, retaining earnings and selling assets. Nonetheless,
						banks are heavily exposed to their own national sovereign debt, a
						development accentuated recently in some countries by the use of LTRO funds
						to purchase additional government bonds. Falling prices in secondary bond
						markets could thus generate losses that banks may not be able to absorb.
						Such falls in prices can coincide with governments’ funding needs being met
						by official channels, especially if private investors believe that official
						investors are unwilling to bear any losses, as was the case with the recent
						debt restructuring in Greece. In turn, losses among banks could undermine
						confidence in public finances and set in motion adverse feed-back loops.

						government headline deficits and debt are durably reduced to below the EU’s
						reference levels of 3% and 60% of GDP, respectively. However, the

						procedures might have helped to prevent the build-up of excessive fiscal
						deficits in some euro area countries, notably Greece, had they been in place
						prior to the crisis. However, by themselves, they would not have prevented
						the underlying problems that eventually led to fiscal imbalances emerging in

						undertake structural reforms. One possible step in the near term would be to
						issue new jointly-guaranteed government bonds to help recapitalise the
						banking sector and encourage the write-off of bad loans, thereby setting the
						stage for increased credit availability. A side-effect of such a measure
						would be to take a step towards the issuance of euro-bonds, which could help
						increase private-sector confidence that such financing will eventually
						emerge as the euro area evolves, at which point sovereign debt crises would
						seem less intractable. A second possibility would be to increase the
						jointly-guaranteed resources available for the European Investment Bank to
						provide financial assistance to new trans-European network infrastructure
						projects, in areas such as transport, energy and telecommunications. Other
						policy measures at the EU level that can improve medium-term growth
						prospects include strengthening and deepening the Single Market; improving
						the EU co-ordination of national innovation policies; further opening
						markets to trade and investment; and enhancing labour mobility within the

						Moreover, if tightening occurs in several countries simultaneously, as is

						limited scope for further monetary policy relaxation, the adverse impact of
						fiscal consolidation on growth could be much stronger than in normal times.
						On the other hand, a number of countries are in acute risk of losing

						numbering="y">While the most immediate priority for financial policy is a
						rapid recognition of bad loans, followed by any necessary recapitalisation,
						especially in the euro area, this should not delay efforts to complete the
						financial reform agenda set out by the G20, as greater clarity about future
						regulation could boost near-term activity, in particular by facilitating
						investment decisions. Although it is important that decisions are made
						rapidly to dissipate regulatory uncertainty, some standards, such as capital
						and liquidity requirements, have to be phased in gradually, as is planned,
						to avoid a credit crunch. More importantly, reform still needs to come to
						full fruition in a number of areas in order to check the risks of repeated
						financial crises in the future. The key priority is to complete the task of
						dealing with the risks associated with large institutions that obtain rents
						as a result of the<emphasis emph="italic"> de facto </emphasis>public
						guarantee against a systemic collapse of the financial sector. Specific
						capital surcharges for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)
						can be a useful tool for this purpose and should be accompanied by
						resolution plans vetted by regulators. Structural separation between retail
						and investment banking could also help to ensure that sufficient regulatory
						capital is available for retail institutions where some form of<emphasis
							emph="italic"> de facto </emphasis>government guarantee cannot be
						completely eliminated. Taxing the value of the residual effective government
						guarantee would reduce the incentive for banks to grow too big to fail.</p>

						numbering="y"> Besides the banking sector, completing financial reform is
						also important in other areas. Close deadlines should be set for the vast
						majority of derivatives to become cleared and settled centrally, whilst
						ensuring that clearing houses enforce sufficient discipline regarding
						collateral requirements. Speeding up convergence in accounting standards
						would enhance the monitoring of risk globally and also help to reduce the
						potential for regulatory arbitrage. Other financial centres could follow the
						US lead to eliminate credit ratings from public rules. In addition, to
						reduce incentives to leverage, governments should review tax biases that
						favour debt accumulation rather than equity financing.</p>

						numbering="y">As discussed above, structural reforms are essential to help
						foster job creation and economic growth and durably tackle global and
						intra-euro area imbalances. However, against a backdrop of soft economic
						activity, there could be a temptation for governments to delay structural
						reforms because of a concern that they might have detrimental short-term
						effects. Recent OECD empirical analysis confirms that the full benefits from
						reforms take time to materialise, but also suggests that some reforms have
						marked positive effects on growth and employment over a period of 3-5 years
						(OECD, 2012d). Relevant examples include stronger active labour market
						policies, such as enhanced job search services, and growth-friendly tax
						reforms that seek to lower direct taxes on labour. Moreover, there is only
						limited evidence that reforms have negative effects in the near term though
						certain labour market measures, such as unemployment benefit and job
						protection reforms, can have mildly negative short-term effects if
						introduced when activity is weak. A broad reform effort, with a well
						designed package of labour and product market reforms, would be most likely
						to deliver overall gains and alleviate the transitional costs of certain
						individual reforms. The short-term impact of structural reforms could also
						be enhanced if accompanied by an effective communication strategy and a
						strong and well-regulated financial sector, thereby fostering confidence and
						enabling households and firms to spend against future reform-driven income
						gains.</p>

						pace of consumer spending. Nevertheless, real GDP growth is projected to
						increase only gradually this year and next, as the economy is still
						overcoming important hurdles. Housing demand has increased noticeably, but
						the overhang of unsold homes and the tide of foreclosures will restrain the
						revival in residential investment.</emphasis></p>

						unemployment benefits, together with automatic federal spending cuts, would
						result in a sharp fiscal retrenchment in 2013 that might derail the
						recovery. Consolidation is necessary, but it should be implemented at a
						steady, gradual pace consistent with a medium-term plan to restore fiscal
						stability. Restricting tax expenditures would lower the deficit while
						reducing market distortions and narrowing income inequality. Monetary policy
						should remain accommodative as long as the extensive economic slack
						persists.</emphasis></p>

						public finances further into uncharted territory. Achieving the government’s

						FY 2020 and putting the public debt ratio on a downward trend from
						FY 2021 is essential to restore fiscal sustainability. The government has
						proposed doubling the consumption tax rate in two steps, from the current 5%
						to 8% in April 2014, and to 10% in October 2015, to finance swelling social
						spending due to population ageing, while reducing the budget deficit.</p>

						ratio, warrant ongoing measures to bring the public finances onto a
						sustainable path. This process of fiscal consolidation has intensified and
						all euro area countries are now undertaking budgetary adjustment. Fiscal
						consolidation will have a particularly sharp effect in countries where the
						fiscal stance is being tightened very rapidly and domestic conditions are
						already weak. The underlying fiscal position is assumed to evolve in line
						with current budgetary plans and commitments under the Stability and Growth
						Pact. However, in general, to the extent that the OECD projections are
						weaker than used for government budget plans, the headline budgetary
						shortfall is compensated only partially in the OECD projections to avoid
						excessive fiscal restraints. The underlying budget balance in the euro area
						is estimated to improve by more than 1¼ percentage point of GDP in 2012 and
						again in 2013. The majority of the fiscal adjustment is taking place through
						reductions in expenditure.</p>

						wage increases may limit gains in price competitiveness. At the same time,
						stronger domestic demand will boost imports. Overall, real GDP growth is

						OECD projects that it will be some time before it returns to neutral. In
						April, the Bank stated that some withdrawal of monetary stimulus may become
						appropriate to achieve the 2% inflation rate target over the medium term. It
						is assumed here that the first policy rate increase will be implemented in
						autumn 2012, which is a few months ahead of current market expectations.
						However, on this projection, further increases towards the neutral rate will
						also be needed in 2013 to hit the inflation target. House prices have risen
						substantially for several years and may have become overvalued in some
						markets. The government has taken steps to rein in mortgage lending, and a
						measured increase in monetary policy rates will reinforce these actions.</p>

						tensions in the sovereign bond market prompted the government to adopt a
						sizable consolidation package for 2012. The main spending measures were
						lower public sector wages, cuts to certain social and retirement benefits,
						and delisting some health services from compulsory health insurance. These
						measures were coupled with a gradual reduction in corporate income taxes and
						other tax incentives to boost investment. Should growth deteriorate further,

						accelerated slightly. In real terms, retail sales growth picked up along

						bringing a slight acceleration in fixed asset investment. The downward
						pressure on output came initially from a decline in exports in late 2011,

						destocking, which was only partially offset by lower imports. This pattern

						lowered for banks operating in rural areas. There have been signs that the

						large fiscal imbalances. Further ahead, demographic changes, including
						ageing, and fundamental forces of economic convergence will bring about
						massive shifts in the composition of global GDP. To illustrate the nature
						and scale of some of the policy challenges posed by these developments, this
						chapter describes medium and long-term scenarios for OECD and non-OECD
						G20 countries using a new modelling framework to extend the short-term
						projections described in  . This framework focuses on the interaction
						between technological progress, demographic change, fiscal adjustment,
						current account imbalances and structural policies. The scenarios suggest

						bring about substantial gains in growth as well as reducing a range of
						risks, particularly by reducing large fiscal and current account

								factors plus labour-augmenting technological progress. By projecting
								these trend input components, assuming a degree of convergence in
								total factor productivity, potential output is also projected over a
								40-year horizon. The degree of convergence in total factor
								productivity depends on the starting point, with countries farther
								away from the technology frontier converging faster, but it also
								depends on the country’s own structural conditions and policies,
								hence the <shortcitation>conditional convergence</shortcitation>
								nomenclature. Given the long time horizon, even the baseline
								scenario includes changes in policies that affect the speed of

								conditions and policies. In this framework, two forces can reduce
								cross-country GDP per capita gaps in the long run: first, countries
								that are initially below their steady state level of GDP per capita
									<shortcitation>catch up</shortcitation> to this level
								principally as a result of accumulation of different kinds of
								capital (human and physical) and improvements in efficiency driven

								demographic effects, captured by old-age and youth dependency
								ratios, are important drivers of long-term trends in saving, but
								with additional effects from fiscal balances, the terms of trade,
								productivity growth, net oil balances and the availability of
								credit. Total saving in OECD countries is then determined as the sum
								of public and private saving, assuming a 40% offset of any
								improvement in public saving from reduced private saving due to
								partial Ricardian equivalence (in line with recent OECD estimates,
								see for example Roehn, 2011). For non-OECD countries, the total
								saving rate is determined according to an equation, which is close
								to being a total economy variant of the private saving equation for
								OECD, with effects from the old-age and youth dependency ratios, the
								terms of trade, the availability of credit, the level of public

							<p id="OCDEid1248890" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Through the

								Arabia, Russia as well as 27 smaller non-OECD countries. For these
								countries, no individual projections of current balances are made.
								Rather, the combined current account balance of all non-OECD oil
								exporting countries is calculated based on projections of their
								balance of trade in oil. The real price of oil is assumed to rise by
								5% per annum to 2020 and continue rising thereafter, but at a more

							<p id="OCDEid1248899" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The fiscal

								debt through a gradual improvement in the primary balance or target
								a specific (usually lower) debt-to-GDP ratio. Debt service responds
								to changes in debt and market interest rates, but with lags which
								reflect the maturity structure of debt. Higher debt levels are
								assumed to entail higher country-specific fiscal risk premia
								consistent with the findings of Égert (2010) and Laubach (2009): for
								every percentage point that the debt ratio exceeds a threshold of
								75% of GDP, the fiscal risk premium applied to long-term interest
								rates increases by 2 basis points, with an additional increase of

						only is it projected to have the highest gross debt ratio in the OECD
						in 2013 at 223% of GDP, but at 9% of GDP in 2013, its structural deficit is
						such that, according to the stylised fiscal rule used in the baseline
						scenario, it would need 13 percentage points of GDP of fiscal consolidation
						before the debt ratio would stabilise. And it would do so at the extreme
						level of more than 260% of GDP. Moreover, because Japan has seen a
						substantial increase in indebtedness over the past two decades with little
						effect so far on interest rates, it is treated as an exception in the
						baseline scenario by assuming that the magnitude of its fiscal risk premium,
						in terms of the increase in interest rates per percentage point of public
						debt ratio beyond certain thresholds, is only one-quarter that of other OECD
						countries. One reason why the risk premium may be low in Japan is the high
						proportion of government debt which is financed from domestic sources. This
						has been possible thanks to a high private saving rate, to a stable domestic
						institutional investor base and to a current account that has been in
						surplus since the early 1980s, so that for the past three decades Japan has
						not had to rely on external sources to finance its government deficits.
						However, in the baseline scenario, Japan’s current account is expected to
						move into deficit by the late 2010s, mostly because of a decline in the
						private saving rate due to population ageing. When this occurs, and the
						government needs to seek foreign sources of financing, foreigners may well
						ask for a more <shortcitation>normal</shortcitation> fiscal risk premium,
						which could quickly generate an unsustainable and unstable situation. Set
						against these arguments, Japanese government financial assets are

								dependency ratios based on fixed age groups when projecting saving
								rates, given that changes in life expectancy and retirement ages are
								also expected in future decades. For the purposes of sensitivity
								analysis, an alternative approach was tried using a rolling
								definition of the old-age dependency ratio for which the upper age
								limit was increased in line with the assumption about the extension
								of working lives. However, this approach eliminated virtually any
								demographically-induced fall in saving rates and was judged too
								extreme. Instead, a compromise approach, adopted for the projections
								reported here, was to incorporate an estimated positive effect from
								increasing longevity on saving, based on Li <emphasis emph="italic"
									>et al</emphasis>. (2007), which acts to partially offset the
								negative effect of rising old-age dependency rates.</p>
						</fnote> Demographic developments (combining the effect of changes in
						old-age and youth dependency ratios as well as life expectancy) are
						estimated to reduce the private saving rate for the median OECD country by
						about 3‐4 percentage points by 2030, with much heterogeneity around this
						median. Increases in OECD public saving, required to stabilise general
						government debt, offset much of the fall in private saving at least until
						the mid-2020s, particularly in Japan and the United States. Among the
						largest non-OECD economies, projected demographic influences on saving are
						even more heterogeneous, with two extreme and important cases being India
						and China. For India, the effect of a falling youth dependency ratio offsets
						much of the effect on saving from a moderate increase in the old-age
						dependency ratio, so that the overall demographic effect on saving is small.
						In contrast, for China, a legacy of the <shortcitation>one-child
							policy</shortcitation> is that the old-age dependency ratio is projected
						to rise more steeply than even in most OECD countries, with little change in
						the youth dependency ratio.</p>

						Their combined share rises from just under 30% in 2010 to 50% by 2030.
						However, large uncertainty surrounds projections for saving rates in
						emerging economies. Firstly, the panel equations used to project saving have
						generally under-estimated the rise in saving, notably in China and India,
						over the past decade, which in turn suggests that there are other, perhaps
						country-specific, factors at work or that saving rates may have overshot
						levels supported by fundamentals. Secondly, future saving rates in emerging

						numbering="y">After narrowing during the global recession of 2008/09, global
						current account imbalances started widening again as economies recovered,
						though they remain well below the peaks seen prior to the crisis. Going
						forward, the same factors that drove increased global financial flows before
						the crisis are projected to continue reasserting themselves. In the baseline
						scenario, a widening of global current account imbalances in the short term
						is mostly a cyclical response given the assumption that output gaps close
						mainly through a recovery in domestic demand, because those countries that
						had been running the largest deficits prior to the crisis (most obviously
						the United States) have more typically experienced sharper downturns than
						those that had been running surpluses (most obviously China but also Germany
						and to a lesser extent Japan). Over the longer term, the negative effect of
						ageing populations on saving is the dominant effect, leading to lower
						current account balances in most OECD countries. China’s current account
						surplus widens until 2030 as the investment rate falls more rapidly than the
						saving rate due to slowing potential growth. Moreover, the increasing share
						of China in world GDP means that the increase in the surplus as a share of
						Chinese GDP becomes a relatively much larger increase as a share of world
						GDP. The current account surplus of oil exporters rises sharply to 2020
						before roughly stabilising as a share of world GDP, reflecting the profile
						of increasing real oil prices which offset the tendency for oil exporters to
						gradually run down any overall current account surplus. Overall, the scale

						pre-crisis (2007) peak by the late 2020s (<xref object="figure" type="sing"

						respectively (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure"
							refid="o112-2012-01-1-P00-c01-s06-04-g006"/>). There are, however, large
						differences in the magnitude of this effect across countries, the effect
						being generally larger in countries with the greatest scope for improvement
						in structural policies relative to best practice. The largest gainers
						include Italy, Korea and Israel, where there are large potential gains from
						raising labour force participation, as well as many countries which
						currently have relatively stringent product market regulation and stand to
						gain around 10% or more of GDP by 2050 by improving competition and so
						speeding up the convergence process. On the other hand, countries such as
						Canada, Denmark, Iceland, and the Netherlands benefit less from structural
						reforms, but this is only because they are currently at, or close to, best
						practices in respect of product market regulation and labour force
						participation. The effects of reform are generally lower when all countries
						take action than they would be if reforms applied to only one country. This
						reflects that simultaneous reform boosts global growth, which again raises
						global interest rates, thereby partially offsetting the positive effect of
						structural reforms on GDP. Exceptions are countries where fiscal
						consolidation is so large that the domestic reduction in interest rates more
						than compensates for this global effect (notably Greece and Japan).</p>

						imbalances – measured as half the sum of individual current balances in

						are approximately 0.7 percentage point of world GDP lower than in the

			<p id="OCDEid1060673" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">This annex contains data on
				key economic series which provide a background to the recent economic developments
				in the OECD area described in the main body of this report. Data for 2011 to 2013
				are OECD estimates and projections. The data in some of the tables have been
				adjusted to conform to internationally agreed concepts and definitions in order to
				make them more comparable across countries, as well as consistent with historical
				data shown in other OECD publications. Regional aggregates are based on weights that
				change each period, with the weights depending on the series considered. For details
				on aggregation, see OECD Economic Outlook Sources and Methods.</p>
			<p id="OCDEid1060683" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The OECD projection methods
				and underlying statistical concepts and sources are described in detail in OECD
				Economic Outlook Sources and Methods (www.oecd.org/eco/sources‐and‐methods).</p>
			<p id="OCDEid1060693" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Corrigenda for the current
				and earlier issues, as applicable, can be found at
				www.oecd.org/publishing/corrigenda.</p>
			<p id="OCDEid1060703" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The statistical data for
				Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli
				authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of
				the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the
				terms of international law.</p>

					<p id="OCDEid1060752" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"> OECD quarterly
						projections are on a seasonal and working-day-adjusted basis for selected
						key variables. This implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted
						annual data may occur, though these in general are quite small. In some
						countries, official forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day
						adjustments. Even when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the
						size of the adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD.
						The cut-off date for information used in the compilation of the projections
						is 15 May 2012.</p>
