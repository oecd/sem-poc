    <blurbMKT>&lt;P&gt;The &lt;I&gt;OECD Economic Outlook&lt;/I&gt; is the OECD’s twice-yearly analysis of the major economic trends and prospects for the next two years.&amp;nbsp; Prepared by the OECD Economics Department, the &lt;I&gt;Outlook&lt;/I&gt; puts forward a consistent set of projections for output, employment, prices and current balances based on a review of each member country and of the induced effect on each of them on international developments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Coverage is provided for all OECD member countries as well as for selected non-member countries. Each issue includes a general assessment, chapters summarising developments and providing projections for each individual country, three to five chapters on topics of current interest, and an extensive statistical annex. Subscribers to the print edition also have access to an online edition, published on the internet six to eight weeks prior to the release of the print edition. In addition to the usual macroeconomic and country assessments and statistical annex with projection data, this issue of the &lt;EM&gt;OECD Economic Outlook&lt;/EM&gt; also includes special chapters on the persistence of high unemployment and drivers and vulnerabilities associated with international capital flows.&lt;/P&gt;</blurbMKT>

Seeking a Durable Recovery for All</mainhead>

      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0001" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The global recovery is becoming self-sustained and more broad based. The recovery is taking place at different speeds, between advanced and emerging economies, but also within the first group of countries. Unemployment remains high across most of the OECD countries. In most, headline inflation has risen strongly, and expectations are also drifting up; however, underlying inflation seems likely to edge up only slowly. Vibrant domestic demand growth, negative supply shocks and strong capital inflows in non-OECD economies are generating inflationary pressures prompting policy restraint that could slow the recovery.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Such a scenario calls for differentiated policy responses in advanced and emerging economies. In both groups of countries structural reforms should play a key role while taking into account country-specific needs and institutional features. In advanced economies, structural reforms can boost potential growth, thereby facilitating fiscal consolidation and easing the pace of monetary policy normalisation. In emerging economies, monetary policy should tighten more to curb inflation, but this option risks being constrained by inducing stronger capital inflows. In emerging economies, structural reforms could make growth more sustainable and inclusive, while contributing to global rebalancing and enhancing long-term capital flows.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0003" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The outlook is surrounded by risks. Some of them are endogenous to the pace of expansion; others are associated with the possibility of specific events. Upside risks include unexpected short-term stimulus from additional structural measures and more buoyant private-sector activity as confidence increases. Some of the risks are two-sided. Oil prices may rise or fall back over the projection period. While the earthquake and tsunami in Japan could have additional negative consequences on activity further reconstruction packages could hasten the rebound. Most risks are on the downside, however, including: further increases in oil and other commodity prices which could feed into core inflation, a deeper slowdown in China, an unsettled fiscal situation in the United States and Japan and renewed weakness in housing markets. Financial vulnerabilities are increasing in the euro area in spite of strong adjustment efforts in peripheral countries. A concern is that, if downside risks interact, their cumulative impact could weaken the recovery significantly, possibly triggering stagflationary developments in some advanced economies.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0004" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">All this suggests that the global crisis may not be over yet. Policy makers must intensify efforts to deal with medium-term challenges. Four such challenges stand out: dealing with high unemployment and preventing it from becoming entrenched; sustaining growth and avoiding stagnation; making progress in fiscal consolidation; and managing global imbalances while supporting orderly saving reallocation. These challenges are interconnected and require a comprehensive and credible policy approach.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0005" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">While the recovery is bringing some improvements in labour market conditions in advanced economies, total, and especially long-term, unemployment remains high in many countries. Also drawing on lessons from the crisis, labour market policies have a key role to play in preventing cyclical unemployment from turning structural. Such policies could include more effective placement services with training to match workers and jobs; rebalancing employment protection towards temporary workers; and temporary reduction in labour taxation through well targeted marginal job subsidies in countries where labour demand is weak. The employment impact of such measures would be boosted by stronger competition in sectors such as retail trade and professional services. Moreover, the crisis has demonstrated the utility of well designed work-sharing arrangements in minimising employment loss during downturns.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0006" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Return to work and competition-enhancing measures would also contribute to stronger potential growth, which could otherwise remain weak. Indeed, as experience shows, following financial crises there are risks of stagnation as structural adjustment and financial repair are delayed. Stagnation could also emerge from persistent deterioration of the structural and business environment. Even if such risks do not materialise the impact of the crisis in lowering potential output is becoming clearer. Such permanent output loss could, eventually, lower realised growth rates. The potential for growth-enhancing structural reforms and policies to unleash new sources of growth is substantial. Governments should intensify their efforts in implementing them.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0007" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Lower growth would feed back negatively on fiscal consolidation, while evidence shows that, beyond some thresholds, public debt levels have a negative impact on growth. In spite of some improvement in fiscal positions, consolidation requirements to merely stabilise debt are substantial for many countries. The United States and Japan, for which such requirements are among the largest, have yet to produce credible medium-term plans while other countries need to bolster medium-term fiscal targets by specifying the measures that will be implemented to achieve them. For most countries, further action would be needed to bring debt levels back to pre-crisis levels. The overall scenario has changed with respect to the pre-crisis situation when a significant contribution to fiscal sustainability came from the fact that interest rates were well below growth rates. This is unlikely to be the case in the years to come as interest rates will rise and growth could be slower. Structural reforms, while boosting growth, can also help fiscal consolidation by increasing efficiency in the provision of key services such as health and education. Finally, it would be dangerous to believe that higher inflation could address debt sustainability. Higher and persistent inflation could damp real growth by raising price and exchange-rate volatility. It could also risk unhinging inflation expectations, with the result that interest rates would soon increase more than inflation.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0008" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Last but not least, imbalances have been widening again as the global economy is recovering. They show, however, a somewhat different configuration as China’s current account surplus is well below pre-crisis peaks due to adverse terms–of–trade movements and less buoyant export performance, and high-saving oil-producing economies see mounting surpluses. A desirable rebalancing mechanism should be growth-enhancing and sufficiently symmetric to avoid putting an excessive burden on deficit countries. Such a rebalancing would require more exchange-rate flexibility, which could also help mitigate inflationary pressures in countries where these are strong, while country-specific structural reforms could help to reduce saving and raise investment in surplus countries, and boost saving in deficit countries. In monetary unions, competition-enhancing reforms of labour and product markets could also facilitate adjustments in external positions.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0009" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The policy challenge is not to eliminate imbalances but to keep them sustainable, so as to facilitate international reallocation of savings in ways that are supportive of growth. This requires open and long-term-oriented capital markets. Structural policies have an important impact on size and composition of capital movements. At the same time there is a need to reconcile open capital markets with the goal of coping with short-term instability through temporary measures. It is important that, including under the auspices of the G20, advanced and emerging economies agree on a framework that would allow such goals to be reconciled.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0010" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The global economy is exiting the recession but is not returning to business as usual. The post-crisis economy will have to deal with old and new challenges, while pursuing new, green and inclusive sources of growth. This requires rethinking the policy paradigm as we draw lessons from the crisis.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In framing the new, post-crisis policy paradigm, some of the existing principles underlying policy should be confirmed, such as those related to supply-side responses to boost growth, while recognising that such policies have additional positive effects on rebalancing and fiscal consolidation. The assignment of monetary policy to achieve price stability and a rule-based fiscal policy to achieve sustainable public finances should be confirmed, while the contribution of fiscal institutions to fiscal discipline could be further explored. But additional lessons should be drawn. The endogenous generation of instability and imbalances out of (apparent) tranquillity, a phenomenon common to several if not all crisis episodes, has been dangerously overlooked. This reinforces the need for financial-sector reform and tighter prudential policies, both at the micro and macro levels.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-01-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0012" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Finally, as a more complex world than what we believed to be the case requires a broader policy tool kit, we also need to take a closer look at how such tools interact and what can be done to enhance synergies. In this vein another lesson from the crisis is that international cooperation is important both in dealing with emergency situations and in shaping the way forward. This requires agreement on common principles, and, if necessary, common rules, while allowing for country-specific needs. As we slowly leave the crisis behind us, we should be wary of the risk of losing impetus in the search for better global economic governance.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-01-p0001" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The recovery from the deepest recession in decades is becoming more broadly based. Global growth has picked up since the soft patch in the middle of last year and activity is driven increasingly by strengthening private final demand. However, progress remains uneven across economies. In the near term, the adverse supply-side shocks from high commodity prices and the earthquake in Japan and its aftermath are damping activity somewhat and pushing up headline inflation. Such effects should fade from the latter half of this year, provided commodity prices stabilise and inflation expectations do not become unanchored. Financial conditions continue to improve and monetary policy remains accommodative in the OECD economies, though increasingly less so in emerging market economies where spare capacity has been largely absorbed. This should allow the recovery to strengthen, despite increasingly widespread fiscal consolidation. Global output growth is expected to be close to 4¼ per cent this year and 4½ per cent in 2012 (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="BDFEDGFJ"/>). On this basis, labour market conditions would continue to improve slowly, though at 7% by the end of 2012, the OECD unemployment rate would still remain well above the pre-crisis level. Underlying inflation is expected to edge up slowly, as economic slack diminishes, to around 1¾ per cent by end-2012. Outside the OECD area, domestic demand is expected to remain robust, necessitating further policy measures to damp inflationary pressures.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-02-p0003" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The risks around the projection remain elevated, even though earlier concerns about possible widespread weakness in private sector activity and deflation outcomes have receded. Some of the key risks are endogenous to the pace of the expansion, whereas others are associated with the possibility of particular events that could trigger renewed weakness in activity or financial markets, or add to inflationary pressures. A further concern is that some of the downside risks, if they were to interact, could result in a mild stagflation-type outcome in the OECD economies, which would be difficult for conventional macroeconomic policies to tackle.</p>

Household and business confidence could strengthen further as the recovery progresses, amidst favourable financial conditions and improving labour market outcomes, giving rise to strong pent-up demand for durables and capital equipment. There is also a possibility that additional near-term impetus could arise from growth-friendly structural reforms, although relatively little progress has been made in this respect since the recovery began.</p>

Higher oil prices would add to inflationary pressures, damp income growth and widen global imbalances by raising further the already elevated external surpluses of the high-saving oil producing economies. Clear risks also remain from continuing concerns about public debt sustainability in some OECD countries and, to a lesser extent, ongoing weaknesses in property markets. If these were to strengthen, they could provoke significant financial market disruption with adverse effects on confidence.</p>

Such reforms would facilitate the tasks facing the monetary and fiscal authorities, and could help to support the near-term recovery. Against the background of impaired fiscal positions, still-high unemployment and the moderate pace of the recovery, priority should be given to implementing reforms that offer comparatively strong short-term employment gains and facilitate fiscal consolidation. These include measures that help to ensure that job losers and other vulnerable groups remain attached to labour markets and quickly return to employment, reforms that increase productivity in the public sector, and measures to improve product market competition. In conjunction with fiscal consolidation in OECD countries, a well-designed package of structural reforms to reduce product market regulations in sheltered sectors of countries with an external surplus, and deepen financial markets and improve social welfare systems in non-OECD countries, would also help to narrow global imbalances over time.</p>

In some countries this will require unblocking political stalemate that makes fiscal policy unpredictable over both short and long horizons. More generally, the pace of consolidation and the choice of policy instruments will have to reflect the urgency of ensuring sustainable public debt dynamics, the strength of the recovery, the enactment of growth-friendly structural reforms and the scope for monetary policy to offset the adverse effects of fiscal tightening. In countries that have unsustainable fiscal positions, an early consolidation <shortcitation>downpayment</shortcitation> would help to give credibility to medium-term plans.</p>

Overall, these factors imply that policy rates should remain accommodative through the projection period. However, the need to keep close-to-zero policy rates for risk management reasons has now faded and an early upward adjustment in policy rates to establish a visibly positive level, as in the euro area, is merited in the United States and the United Kingdom, but not yet in Japan. This would also help to guard against a renewed build-up of financial fragilities and provide a better starting point in event of a need to react to upside inflation surprises. After a pause, and provided the initial rises do not have adverse effects on the recovery, policy rates should be raised steadily in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom in the course of 2012, reflecting the gradual, though incomplete, erosion of economic slack and the edging up of underlying inflation. In larger non-OECD economies, and several smaller OECD economies, monetary conditions should be tightened further to contain inflation. It also remains important, both in OECD and non-OECD countries, that exchange rate adjustments consistent with domestic needs and necessary international rebalancing be allowed to occur.</p>

At the same time, the momentum toward financial reform needs to be maintained to strengthen the stability of the global financial system: in this regard, implementing the recent global agreement on capital and liquidity standards should be seen as the first building block of a broader regulatory structure. Beyond this, progress is needed to reduce significant vulnerabilities that could arise from the failures of systemically important financial institutions.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-p0011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Global economic activity is becoming more self-sustaining, with the recovery driven increasingly by stronger private final demand. In the near term, the supply-side shocks arising both from high food and energy prices, in part due to the political disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and from the earthquake and its aftermath in Japan are damping the momentum of the recovery somewhat. However, such effects seem likely to fade from the latter half of the year. Surveys of business confidence and order levels generally remain robust in most major economies in both manufacturing and service sectors, outside of Japan and several other Asian economies, and point to ongoing improvements in hiring and investment, notwithstanding their recent tendency to overstate the growth of real output. With still-improving financial conditions, still-strong growth in emerging and developing economies, and accommodative monetary policies, the forces acting on OECD economies are favourable on balance, although the pace of the recovery is likely to remain constrained by ongoing adjustments in property markets, still-high unemployment and the gradual withdrawal of crisis-related support. As is often the case following a severe financial crisis (Haugh <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2009), the recovery is relatively slow (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-g001"/>), with OECD-wide output expected to surpass the pre-crisis peak level only by the middle of this year.</p>

Several monthly trade and global indicators, notably export orders, point to trade growth gaining further momentum, but these are being offset, at least in the second quarter, by the disruption to global supply chains and Japanese export capacity in the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs01"/>). Japanese export volumes are projected to decline by over 11% at an annualised rate in the second quarter, before bouncing back in the third quarter. Global trade is expected to generally remain buoyant through the latter half of 2011 and rise by around 8½ per cent in 2012, with trade growth close to the average pre-crisis (2004-2008) rate of 1.7 times world output growth (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-g003"/> and <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDHAEEG"/> below).</p>

According to the Japanese government’s preliminary estimate (Cabinet Office, 2011), the earthquake and tsunami caused some 16-25 trillion yen (3.3% to 5.2% of GDP) of damage to the capital stock in seven prefectures.<boxnoteref refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs01-n01" format="boxnoteref"/> The impact was focused mainly on three prefectures – Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima – which account for about 4% of nationwide economic output and 4.5% of Japan’s population, with the impact concentrated along the Pacific coast in these prefectures. The figures include damage to buildings (housing and fixed capital of private firms), public utilities (electricity, gas and water), public infrastructure (such as railroads, ports and highways) and public parks.</p>
                <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-p0016" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The experience of past disasters in Japan and other developed countries suggests that any negative short-term impact on economic growth (relative to trend) is likely to be soon followed by a rebound as reconstruction spending picks up (see Cavallo and Noy, 2010). The sizable damage to the capital stock and near-term disruption of supply chains have already resulted in a sizable decline in output. Industrial production plummeted by over 15% in March, the sharpest drop on record. GDP declined at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the first quarter, pushing Japan into recession, and a further decline is likely in the second quarter of 2011. Thereafter, activity should rebound promptly, and grow at above-trend rates in the latter half of 2011, boosted by government reconstruction spending as well as business and residential investment, as was the case in the aftermath of the 1995 Kobe earthquake (see OECD, 2011b for the details).</p>
                <p id="OCDEid1191552" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The uncertainty surrounding any projection is particularly acute in these circumstances, not least because the reduced capacity of electricity generation and the disruption to supply chains creates uncertainty about the depth and length of the decline in output. Indeed, the earthquake and tsunami damaged a number of thermal as well as nuclear power plants, which supply around 30% of Japan’s electricity. And estimates by the MIT Billion Prices Project suggest that the range of consumer products available on line has declined by approximately by 15% since the natural disasters.</p>
                <p id="OCDEid1191557" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The adverse effects have also begun to be reflected in other hard data, which also show large negative impacts in March. Exports fell by 2.3% (and by 9.7% for the period after the natural disaster) while imports increased by 11.9% (9.5% after the natural disaster) in March (year-on-year). Retail sales in March plunged by 8.5% (year–on-year), likely reflecting a sizeable negative impact on discretionary spending from supply constraints as well as weaker consumer sentiment and voluntary self-restraint (<emphasis emph="italic">jishuku</emphasis>).</p>

Even if a large decline in imports to Japan were to occur, arising, for example, from a decline in domestic demand, it would have only a small direct effect on overall economic activity for most countries. For example, in the United States and the euro area, exports to Japan account for less than 0.5% of GDP (see figure below). The impact would be modest even in neighbouring Asian economies where bilateral trade with Japan is relatively more important, as for instance exports to Japan account for 2% of GDP in China. </p>
                <p id="OCDEid1182604" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">However, indirect effects could be more severe in the near-term. Although the direct impacts are likely to be limited, the near-term loss of Japanese exports has marked effects on industrial activity elsewhere, through highly integrated cross-border supply chains and a reliance on just-in-time inventory management. One illustration is provided by the number of car manufacturers     in     North     America     and     Europe     who     have     stopped     or      reduced      production      temporarily because of a shortage of key components sourced from Japan. Japanese manufacturing is an important contributor to a number of industries elsewhere; for example, more than 10% of the total supply of some electronic products in the United States is imported from Japan (Japan Research Institute, 2011). Prices have already risen for some electrical components (for instance, flash memory chips), as a result of the production disruption in Japan, especially in cases where alternative suppliers cannot be found.<boxnoteref refid="CHDCDCJD" format="boxnoteref"/> These negative impacts ultimately depend on the availability and substitutability of other products.</p>

                <p id="OCDEid1182659" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">It is difficult to assess the extent to which certain Japanese products play a key role in cross-border vertical linkages. Japan’s outward FDI and export data suggest that these matter mainly for Asian economies. In China, 13% of total imports are from Japan (or 2.6% of GDP). In the United States and the euro area, the share is much lower (6.1% and 3.4% of total imports, or 0.7% and 0.5% of GDP, respectively). According to a recent survey by the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO, 2010), Japanese affiliates in Asia and Pacific regions rely relatively heavily on procurement from Japan. In manufacturing, the procurement of raw materials and parts from Japan accounts for a third of total procurement. Local procurement represents just under a half of total procurement. Procurement from Japan tends to be particularly high amongst firms in the electric machinery and precision instrument industries. In the United States, by contrast, Japanese affiliates tend to rely more on local procurement. At least one-half, and in many cases 80% to 100%, of procurement is sourced locally for around two-thirds of Japanese affiliates (JETRO, 2008). Hence the production disruption and its related consequences from events in Japan would be more severe for Japanese affiliates in neighbouring countries in Asia.</p>
                <p id="OCDEid1182664" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Another possible source of global effects could be through capital flows, since foreign insurance companies have incurred some new liabilities in Japan as a result of the natural disasters, and domestic financial institutions could need to repatriate some assets held abroad. However, so far, there does not appear to have been a sizable repatriation of assets by domestic institutions, with those institutions in need of cash having largely raised funds in Japan.</p>

                <p id="OCDEid1175254" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The production disruption and its consequences could have some longer-term global effects. The expansion of cross-border vertical linkages might slow or even be reversed, insofar as producers might revise their just-in-time inventory management in order to have larger buffers and might strive for greater diversification of their suppliers, especially geographically, at the expense of immediate efficiency gains.</p>
                <p id="OCDEid1175259" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the short run at least, oil and gas demand in Japan is likely to be bolstered as losses in energy production from damage to nuclear power plants need to be offset, and energy-intensive reconstruction work will be in progress. More generally, at a global level, if countries were prompted to revisit their nuclear electricity production policy, it would have to be offset by increasing demand for other traditional energy resources such as oil and gas, improvements in the efficiency of energy use and possibly more intensive exploitation of alternative energy resources.</p>

Thus there is some possibility for firms to switch to suppliers from other countries.

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-03-p0031" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Many emerging market economies have continued to experience strong output growth in recent quarters, and capacity constraints have started to become increasingly apparent, with commodity prices and underlying inflation both rising. The expansion has been fuelled in part by strong domestic credit growth and robust private final demand, which has helped to boost the export markets of OECD economies, but also created new policy challenges for non-OECD economies. Past moves to tighten monetary policies and, in some countries, embark on fiscal consolidation, together with the drag on real incomes from higher commodity prices, are however starting to moderate activity. In China, GDP growth softened to an annualised rate of 8¾ per cent in the first quarter, with retail sales still rising strongly but investment slackening. Ongoing monetary policy tightening and higher inflation have begun to damp income and credit growth, and recent PMI surveys point to some near-term softening in activity. In contrast, PMI surveys have yet to weaken noticeably in India, although private investment is now moderating after strong growth through much of last year. In Brazil, where the output gap closed rapidly in the aftermath of the recession, fiscal consolidation has begun and output growth has started to slow, with strong investment growth being offset by a continued drag on growth from net trade, in part due to the marked appreciation of the exchange rate fuelled by strong capital inflows. In contrast, growth has begun to pick up in Russia and South Africa, with higher international commodity prices helping to stimulate activity.</p>

Abundant global liquidity has resulted in historically low sovereign spreads in many economies, though stock prices have been volatile, with net equity outflows to developed countries since the beginning of this year. Tighter policy settings in China have led to a slowing in bank lending growth. Underlying credit dynamics are however difficult to assess in China, because the authorities have introduced month-by-month lending quotas in place of the previous annual quota that led banks to make large amounts of loans at the beginning of the year.</p>

This suggests that uncertainty about the pace and durability of the recovery, along with the comparatively modest level of activity in IT sectors in recent months, may have been damping investment growth somewhat. But capital-goods orders have picked up in many major OECD economies and survey-based measures of investment intentions have continued to rise, pointing to solid growth ahead in equipment investment. Reconstruction expenditure in the aftermath of the natural disasters should also lead to a large jump in investment levels in Japan from the second half of this year. With business investment intensity still well below pre-crisis levels (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-09-g006"/>), and uncertainty about the recovery likely to fade further, normal cyclical forces and healthier financial conditions should encourage strong upward momentum in investment levels over the projection period.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-08-n01"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-08-p0042" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A simple indicator-type model for business investment in the United States, in which investment growth is related to current and past lags of survey measures of investment intentions and the OECD US financial conditions index, points to solid growth in investment volumes of just over 9% this year, compared with a projected rise of 8¼ per cent. For the euro area, where information on investment intentions is less timely and published less frequently, an indicator-type model using survey measures of production expectations and the euro area financial conditions index is found to track business investment reasonably
well. This model points to investment growth of just over 6½ per cent in the euro area in 2011, a little stronger than the projected rise of 5¼ per cent.</p></fnote></p>

Some signs of improvement are now appearing, although prices generally remain well below pre-recession levels. Commercial property values are now rising in the euro area and the United Kingdom, in part reflecting the support provided by low interest rates, but in the United States, where there is considerable excess capacity, commercial property prices in nominal terms remain low and volatile. Global office rents have also now begun rising, especially in major cities, with vacancy rates turning down. Despite these improvements, conditions have remained fragile in several commercial property markets, with many OECD countries still seeing increasing numbers of distressed properties coming onto the market, suggesting that investment in new structures will remain low for some time to come.</p>

Notwithstanding recent increases in investment, the ratio of housing investment to GDP remains below both the average level seen in past troughs and the average level over the past 3 decades in the OECD as a whole and the aggregate euro area. Canada and Finland are notable exceptions, in part reflecting their relatively high price elasticity of housing supply (OECD, 2011a). House price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios are close to their long-term averages in the OECD as a whole (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDIEGCC"/>), but there are considerable disparities across countries. In several economies in which price-to-rent ratios are more than 50% above their long-run average, real prices may be close to peaking, despite still-low real interest rates (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs06"/> below). In contrast, long-standing declines in real house prices are persisting in the United States, Spain and Ireland, and have now begun once more in the United Kingdom. Survey indicators are generally weak in these markets, and an overhang of unsold properties will take time to clear. Unsettled legal disputes around foreclosure proceedings may also prolong adjustment in the United States. This will likely damp new construction for some time, although there is some evidence that real prices may be nearing a trough in these economies (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs06"/>).</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0052" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Household saving rates have recently begun to edge down in many OECD countries, though they still remain elevated relative to pre-crisis norms. Asset price increases, higher saving and associated debt deleveraging have all helped to repair household balance sheets since the recovery began, softening the need for any additional increases in saving rates for balance-sheet purposes. Improving labour market outcomes and credit conditions may also continue to diminish the need for precautionary saving. Wealth-to-income ratios are now above 5-10 year pre-crisis averages in the United Kingdom, and, in the euro area, are close to the peak level since the formation of the euro area. This suggests that the saving ratio might soften further in these economies, provided credit conditions do not deteriorate. In the United States, additional balance sheet adjustment is likely to be required, reflecting ongoing housing market weakness and the consequent implications for household net worth. But with debt on a clearly declining trajectory, a higher saving rate will not be required to ensure adjustment. Indeed, with the rate of job creation gathering pace, the US saving ratio is projected to edge down by around ¾ of a percentage point from the current level of 5¾ per cent over the projection period. In Japan, the uncertainty created by the earthquake and its aftermath may increase household precautionary saving for a while, although this could be offset, at least in part, by the need to finance replacement of lost goods and property.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-n02"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0053" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Consumption might also be postponed temporarily due to the supply-side disruptions and the related unavailability of products.</p></fnote> An updated comparison of actual and trend car sales, with the latter derived as in Haugh<emphasis emph="italic"> et al. </emphasis>(2010), provides

Brent crude oil prices have increased by around 50% since mid 2010 (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-14-g009"/>), and volatility has been high. Up to the end of 2010, most of the increase in the oil price seemed to relate to strong oil demand outside the OECD area (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs02"/>). More recently, political unrest in the MENA region has caused prices to surge further, reflecting concerns that supply disruptions might spread. Increased oil and gas imports by Japan in the aftermath of the natural disaster may also be adding to upward pressures on prices. Prices for non-oil commodities have also increased steeply, surpassing their record levels of 2008 for many items. The rise in oil prices and adverse weather conditions in different regions of the world are the main drivers of rising international food prices.</p>

Supply side factors also play a role. Crude oil supply levelled off in the middle of the last decade. Long time lags between investment decisions and new oil production coming on stream, declining oil production from many conventional oil fields outside OPEC and shortages of qualified labour all contributed to this development. Climatic and geopolitical factors, production cuts by OPEC and low levels of spare capacity as well as constraints in the refining system have at times also restrained supply. However, higher prices have been accompanied by renewed growth in OPEC production capacity in 2009 and 2010. In the current episode of rising oil prices, political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East caused prices to surge further, both reflecting direct supply disruptions and concerns that they might spread.</p>

Low real interest rates are likely to have contributed to the upward pressure on oil prices. Lower interest rates make it less profitable for producers to extract oil and invest the proceeds on the financial market, which might reduce the supply of oil, putting upward pressure on the spot price. At the same time, the opportunity costs of holding stocks of oil decline, which can put upward pressure on oil demand. Indeed, estimates from a simple structural vector auto-regression model suggest that a reduction in the US 3‑month real interest rate by one percentage point could push up oil prices by about $4 cumulatively by the end of the second year after the shock occurred.<boxnoteref refid="CHDEBJJA" format="boxnoteref"/> While the precise size of the effect is subject to uncertainty, and is likely to depend on the initial level of oil prices, the estimates suggest that the marked reductions in short-term interest rates that occurred in response to the crisis could have contributed substantially to the recent upswing in oil prices.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1237437" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Buoyant income growth in emerging markets, coupled with deepening world trade integration, was also an important driver for the upswing in non-oil commodity prices. With respect to food, rising underlying demand growth for meat in emerging markets is part of this effect. Adverse supply side factors also played a role. In particular, rising oil prices contributed substantially to rising prices for non-oil commodities, food in particular, whose production is generally energy intensive. For food, this link was reinforced by bio-fuel policies. Between 2000 and 2009, global output of bio-ethanol quadrupled and production of biodiesel increased   tenfold,   with   government   support   policies   having    been    a    major    driver    behind    the    up swing.<boxnoteref refid="CHDIIIFD" format="boxnoteref"/></p>
              <p id="OCDEid1233696" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Increases in the price of oil enhance ethanol’s competitiveness relative to petrol and strengthen its demand. With both bio-energy and food utilising the same inputs and the supply elasticity of crops limited in the short run, increases in the production of ethanol reduce the supply of crops for food and raise food prices. Supply disruptions due to extreme weather conditions added to upward pressure on prices, as did export restrictions in some traditional large commodity-export countries.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1233705" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Moreover, concerns have been expressed that commodity prices may have been pushed up by speculation. Indeed, net long positions (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>current purchases for future selling) held by non-commercial oil traders have markedly increased on average over recent years as oil prices were trending upwards (see second figure). However, recent commodity price increases have been broad-based, including in particular certain food commodities for which organised futures markets do not exist. This suggests that factors other than financial market speculation are the main drivers for a number of commodity prices, although oil prices could be a channel through which financial factors influence other commodities as well.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1233714" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Also, information concerning future oil prices is conflicting. On the one hand, record levels of net long positions by non-commercial traders appear to indicate expectations of further rising oil prices. On the other hand, with the futures curve flat until end-2011 and bending downwards thereafter, lower oil prices are expected in the future – though caveats apply to the information content of oil futures.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1233719" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Overall, forces acting on commodity prices point in different directions. On the one hand, rising oil demand by emerging markets, and only modest additions to world oil supply capacity over the next couple of years, put upward pressure on prices. On the other hand, other factors, such as likely increases in interest rates over the next couple of years, suggest that oil and food prices might well come down from current high levels, the more so if geopolitical tensions were to abate and food production benefitted from less extreme weather conditions.</p>

For example, the share of food items in domestic private consumption is around 14% in the United States and 19% in Japan. The raw material part of private consumption baskets is much lower though, due to trade margins and various non-commodity inputs into food production. Back-of-the-envelope calculations with these factors taken into consideration, and under the assumption of unchanged exchange rates and nominal incomes, suggest that a sustained increase in food and oil commodity prices of the size seen over the past six months would mechanically reduce, all else being equal, households’ real disposable incomes by almost 1½ per cent in the major OECD areas. Economy-wide income effects would be smaller though, with domestic food producers benefitting from price increases and consumption patterns adjusting in favour of goods with smaller relative price increases. Empirical estimates suggest that the short-term impact of a $10 increase in crude oil prices could be two-tenths of a percentage point lower GDP growth in the OECD area over the first two years (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDBCIGC"/>).</p>

Growth in the non-OECD economies remained robust. Looking ahead, the recovery is expected to gain further momentum only slowly (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-01-g012"/>), notwithstanding the support provided by still-accommodative monetary policies throughout the projection period and favourable financial conditions. Necessary fiscal consolidation (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs03"/>), adverse terms-of-trade effects and continued headwinds from the legacies of the recession in labour, housing and credit markets will all check the pace of the upturn in the OECD. As a result, it seems likely that economic slack will still remain in most OECD economies at the end of the projection period.</p>

Nonetheless, the momentum of the recovery is likely to remain muted, with a modest drag on activity from fiscal consolidation in 2012. Low interest rates, strong corporate profits and normal cyclical forces should support robust growth in equipment investment, but excess supply in property markets will continue to weigh on housing and commercial property investment for some time. Private consumption growth should be helped by further improvements in labour market conditions, but ongoing balance-sheet adjustment is likely to constrain the extent to which the household saving rate can fall. With a continuation of the recent pick-up in employment growth, the unemployment rate is projected to decline to around 7½ per cent by the end of 2012, still well above the pre-crisis level.</p>

Where policy changes have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. Where government plans are available for 2012, fiscal projections follow the plans. Otherwise, in countries with impaired public finances, a tightening of the underlying primary balance of 1% of GDP in 2012 has been built into the projections. Where there is insufficient information to determine the allocation of budget cuts, the presumption is that they apply equally to the spending and revenue side, and are spread proportionally across components. These conventions allow for needed consolidation in countries where plans have not been announced at a sufficiently detailed level to be incorporated in the projections. Along this line, the following assumptions were adopted (with additional adjustments if OECD and government projections for economic activity differ):</p>

Given the experience of past disasters in Japan and elsewhere, the large negative impact on GDP in the first and second quarters is expected to be reversed quickly as reconstruction efforts get underway. Strong growth in both public and private investment is projected in the latter half of the year and the early months of 2012 to replace housing and fixed capital assets destroyed in the disaster, and export growth should bounce back as supply chains are restored. Private consumption is also projected to pick up from the latter half of this year. However, after a temporary sharp decline in the second quarter, import volume growth is likely to be higher than otherwise, given the need for higher oil imports to replace nuclear power. Over the year to the fourth quarter of 2011 output is projected to be broadly constant, but calendar year growth is likely to be negative this year. By the latter half of 2012, as the level of reconstruction spending falls, growth is expected to soften, with public consumption and fixed investment both contracting as consolidation efforts strengthen. The unemployment rate is expected to decline only gently over the projection period to 4½ per cent, thus remaining above its pre-crisis level.</p>

Growth is becoming better balanced, with final private demand expected to strengthen gradually through the projection period, with the effects from still-accommodative monetary policy and favourable financial conditions outweighing the drag exerted by fiscal consolidation and the near-term pressures on real incomes from high energy prices. Labour market conditions are likely to improve, with output growth increasingly accompanied by net job creation, but the unemployment rate is projected to decline only to around 9% by the end of next year, leaving still-sizable economic slack. Labour market improvements should augment the boost to private consumption from low interest rates, strengthening confidence and leading to further reductions in the saving rate. Business investment should also continue to recover from extraordinarily low post-crisis levels, helped by normal cyclical effects and favourable financing conditions. As discussed in <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs04"/>, economic prospects are projected to remain uneven within the euro area.</p>

This adjustment is particularly forceful in countries that have asked for assistance from the European Union and the IMF and are facing intense financial market scrutiny. In these economies, sizable fiscal consolidation is being implemented, area-wide monetary policy is tighter than appropriate on purely domestic grounds, and private sector demand is constrained by still-weak balance sheets and adverse labour market conditions. However, some signs of rebalancing are appearing, with external competitiveness now improving in Ireland and Greece, on the back of falling unit labour costs, which should boost export growth over the projection period. Domestic demand is projected to weaken in Portugal, Greece and Ireland in both 2011 and 2012, but strong export growth could result in modest GDP growth by 2012, except in Portugal.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-04-p0100" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The necessary budget consolidation in these countries is proceeding. In Greece, budget consolidation in 2010 amounted to around 7½ per cent of GDP, a little less than targeted. On the OECD projection, this effort is set to be followed by additional reductions in the underlying deficit of around 4¼ per cent of GDP in 2011 and 1% in 2012, in line with EU/IMF programme targets. In Ireland, the budget deficit ballooned in 2010 due to bank rescue costs, but the underlying deficit is now projected to be cut by 3½ per cent of potential GDP (5% in terms of the underlying primary balance) from 2010 to 2012, in line with the agreement with the European Union and the IMF. In Portugal, strong consolidation is underway this year and further measures will be introduced in the context of the EU/IMF financial assistance programme; the underlying fiscal deficit is projected to decline by 4¼ and 2¼ per cent of potential GDP in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, notwithstanding these consolidation efforts, the ratio of gross government debt to GDP will climb to almost 160% in Greece, about 125% in Ireland and around 115% in Portugal by 2012. Governments in all three countries have contingent liabilities related to explicit and implicit guarantees of banks which could raise government gross debt ratios even further.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-04-p0101" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Some structural reforms have been introduced to facilitate the necessary adjustment. Greece committed to wide-ranging structural reforms as part of the financial assistance package, including easing of restrictions in product markets, strengthening adjustment capacity in labour markets and revamping the pension system. Many of these commitments have already been translated into law, although legislation and implementation has fallen behind schedule in some cases. Similarly, Ireland will implement labour market reforms as part of its agreement with the EU and IMF. Structural reforms also feature prominently in the programme in Portugal, including adjustments to employment protection and benefit systems.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-04-p0102" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Despite financing support, strong fiscal consolidation efforts, structural reforms and signs of rebalancing, sovereign spreads have continued to widen in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. In mid-May, 10-year government bond yields were around 16% in Greece and 10% in Ireland and Portugal; shorter maturities carried even higher yields. Thus, markets have priced in significant probabilities of sovereign debt restructuring occurring in these countries. For example, in Greece, the market price of insurance against sovereign default corresponds to a 64% probability that the government will default over the next two years (assuming a 45% loss in the event of default). Even if the governments are more or less on track to meet their fiscal targets, their fiscal positions would not be sustainable if market interest rates were to remain for long at their current level.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-04-p0103" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">At the same time, banks in Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been cut off from market finance and are dependent on liquidity provided by the ECB. This has been made possible by the decision of the ECB to relax its standards on the quality of collateral it accepts for repurchase agreements. At the end of February, the three countries accounted for 55% of all liquidity provided by the ECB.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1262247" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The ultimate goal for Greece, Ireland and Portugal is to achieve sustainable fiscal positions and restore access to market finance for governments and banks. In the absence of a return of market confidence regarding solvency risks, the unsustainable situation can be tackled in different ways:</p>
              <randlist type="bullet">
                <li id="OCDEid1262255" numbering="y">
                  <p id="OCDEid1262258" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A first option is that foreign official lenders keep funding these governments at interest rates well below current market yields in exchange for additional measures to restore fiscal sustainability. However, if eventually any of these countries were to be unable to repay their debts at the interest rate on offer, such continued assistance would only have postponed the resolution of unsustainable positions. Also, while expectations about continued assistance could calm markets in the short term, it might drive up market yields on government debt if investors judged that official finance reduced the value of their claims, particularly if official loans were seen to have<emphasis emph="italic"> de facto </emphasis>senior status. Unless such senior assistance reduces the probability of default significantly, it thus translates into higher risk premia (Gros, 2010, and Chamley and Pinto, 2011).</p>
                </li>
                <li id="OCDEid1262268" numbering="y">
                  <p id="OCDEid1262271" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A second option is to reschedule the existing stock of debt. However, for heavily indebted countries government debt would have to be rescheduled over a very extended period, and at low interest rates to restore fiscal sustainability.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="OCDEid1262277" numbering="y">
                  <p id="OCDEid1262280" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">At least in theory, a third option is to reduce the size of government liabilities in line with current market expectations. In practice, however, the use of this option is severely circumscribed by the need to find adequate answers to three issues: how to avoid a breakdown of domestic financial sectors, which would have calamitous effects; how to address spillovers to other countries through the financial system; and how to prevent contagion effects from one country to others.</p>

The near-term softening in the growth rate of GDP is projected to continue into the latter half of this year, with domestic demand damped by the effects of tighter monetary conditions, rising headline inflation and some near-term adverse effects from weakness in the Japanese economy. As these effects fade, domestic demand is expected to strengthen once more, helped by ongoing public investment in social housing. In India, further fiscal consolidation and continued monetary policy tightening should help GDP growth moderate to a more sustainable rate of around 8½ per cent per annum over the projection period. Domestic demand will remain a key source of growth, led by private investment underpinned by buoyant corporate sentiment and a need for higher infrastructure spending. In Brazil, domestic demand is also set to remain solid and be driven by large infrastructure and energy development programmes, although ongoing policy normalisation and continued small declines in net exports should help keep growth at trend rates. In Russia, domestic demand is projected to increase strongly, supported by the high level of commodity prices. Despite the drag from strong import growth and tighter monetary conditions, output growth is expected to be around 5% in 2011 and 4½ per cent in 2012.</p>

In Japan, the headline inflation rate has now stopped declining for the first time in almost two years, although the planned rebasing of the consumer price index in August is expected to reduce the annual inflation rate by around ½ of a percentage point. The increase in headline inflation is even more marked in many emerging market economies, reflecting the greater weight of food and energy in total consumption in these economies and the greater energy intensity of production. There are also clear signs that underlying inflationary pressures are now building up in economies such as China, India, Brazil and Indonesia as a result of domestic capacity constraints. </p>

The rise in long-term inflation expectations (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-07-g014"/>), notwithstanding some near-term volatility, suggests that part of the recent rise in headline inflation may now be expected to persist for longer than previously thought. Survey-based long-term expectations have risen only slightly in the major OECD countries, but measures of long-term inflation expectations derived from yield differences between nominal and indexed bonds have increased more substantially over the past year. Though part of this rise could reflect the correction of past mis-measurement, stemming from a flight to more liquid nominal bonds during the crisis, these expectation measures have now returned to or surpassed pre-crisis levels, suggesting some market perceptions that inflationary pressures are developing. The recent strength of gold prices, a traditional hedge against inflation, may also point to concerns about future inflation.</p>

          <p id="p-001" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Core inflation rates, abstracting from the direct effects of food and energy price inflation, are now edging up in OECD economies, but only gently and from a low level. The drift-up in core inflation likely reflects the diminishing drag on inflation from the economic slack that remains in labour and product markets (Moccero <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2011). However, the level and rate of change of such slack is becoming harder to judge in some OECD economies, especially those in which unemployment is now falling relatively sharply and those in which survey-based measures of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector have moved close to normal levels, despite estimates of still-large negative economy-wide output gaps (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-07-g015"/>).</p>

Labour-cost pressures are also still modest (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-07-g013"/>), with wage pressures remaining muted in most major economies, even as labour productivity is strengthening, reflecting continued labour market slack. In the United States, the annual rate of core inflation is projected to drift up from around 1% at present to just above 1½ per cent over the projection period. In the euro area, core inflation is expected to edge up from 1¼ per cent in the latter half of this year to 1½ per cent by the latter half of 2012. Deflation is expected to persist in Japan. These figures include price-level adjustments from indirect tax increases and higher administered prices, which are also pushing up the core inflation rate temporarily in the United Kingdom and several economies in the periphery of the euro area (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs05"/>). Some further progress is likely to be made in reversing past cost inflation patterns within the euro area. If additional structural measures to improve competitive pressures in product and labour markets were to be introduced in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, this might help the necessary price adjustment that needs to take place within the euro area.</p>

For example, the weights of goods and services subject to VAT in the CPI are close to 90% in the large advanced OECD economies and the weight of administered prices is around 10% in the euro area.<boxnoteref refid="CHDJCDCC" format="boxnoteref"/> In the extreme case where VAT is levied on all items in the CPI at the standard rate and the increase is fully passed through into prices, a one percentage point increase in the rate of VAT would raise the level of the consumer price index by 0.8 to 1% depending on the initial rate. In practice, producers and distributors may reduce their margins to protect sales. A recent study based on UK experience puts the pass-through of indirect tax increases at 0.5 in the short term (Bank of England, 2010, and OECD, 2011c). By contrast, increases in administered prices have immediate effects.</p>

If the impact of increases in indirect tax rates has been the same on core inflation, fiscal measures would more than explain the increase in core inflation in the year to January 2011: excluding taxes and administered prices, core inflation in the early months of 2011 may have been close to ½ per cent. If taxes were excluded, core price levels would be broadly stable (Portugal) or falling (Greece, Ireland and Spain).<boxnoteref refid="CHDEAFII" format="boxnoteref"/> In January 2011, the standard VAT rates have been raised by 2 percentage points in Portugal and two reduced VAT rates have been increased by 1 and 2 percentage points respectively in Greece.<boxnoteref refid="CHDGHBGD" format="boxnoteref"/> Given the weights of Portugal and Greece, these VAT increases are estimated to have raised euro area HICP inflation by 0.1 percentage point.</p>

Labour market conditions are now improving modestly, and for the first time in the post-crisis period unemployment rates are now stable or declining in the majority of OECD economies. Survey measures of hiring intentions are also strengthening (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-g016"/>), and stronger labour demand is now gradually being met through new hiring rather than through an increase in hours worked, contrary to the first year of the recovery. Total OECD employment is projected to rise by around 1% this year and 1¼ per cent in 2012 (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDJFBAF"/>). With labour force participation rates expected to increase somewhat in most economies, after having held up better in the recent past than in earlier downturns, in part due to structural reforms such as the closing down of early retirement pathways out of the labour market, the OECD-wide unemployment rate is projected to decline to around 7% by the end of 2012 (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-g018"/>). This would still leave a degree of labour market slack in most large OECD economies, helping to keep wage pressures in check, even allowing for the extent to which factors such as higher long-term unemployment and unemployment benefit extensions may have pushed up the natural rate of unemployment in some countries (Guichard and Rusticelli, 2010; Weidner and Williams, 2011). Germany is a striking exception. There, the unemployment rate is already well below pre-crisis levels, helped by earlier labour market reforms and the flexibility provided by short-time working accounts, and is projected to fall by a further percentage point over the projection period. The increasing tightness
in German labour markets suggests that wage pressures might strengthen further beyond the projection period. In the United States, the unemployment rate is also projected to decline relatively sharply, reflecting stronger employment growth as well as the impact from the assumed phased reduction in the maximum duration of benefit eligibility through 2012.</p>

In contrast to earlier recessions and recoveries, this issue has now also become a concern in the United States, where there has been a long-run downward trend in the outflow rate from unemployment and the mean duration of unemployment remains historically high, with about 44% of the unemployed having been out of work for 27 weeks or more. Reforms that could help to foster near-term employment growth and minimise the employment cost of the recession are discussed in detail in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>. They include: strengthening public employment services and training programmes to improve the matching of workers and jobs; rebalancing employment protection towards less-strict protection for regular workers, but more protection for temporary workers; and temporary reductions in labour taxation, where feasible through well-targeted marginal job subsidies (for new hires where net jobs are rising) rather than through across-the-board reductions in payroll taxes. Reforms to strengthen competitive pressures in sectors in which there is a strong potential for new job growth, such as retail trade and professional services, could also improve labour market outcomes relatively quickly.</p>

The US external deficit is projected to widen by just over ½ per cent of GDP, and the euro area in aggregate is projected to move into a small external surplus, with ongoing progress in reducing intra-area trade imbalances. The Chinese current account surplus is projected to be around 4½ per cent of GDP, well below earlier peaks, with adverse terms-of-trade effects and a more modest rate of improvement in export performance helping to keep the surplus lower than in the recent past. However, global imbalances will be kept elevated by the large rise projected in the external surpluses of the high-saving non-OECD oil-producing economies, on the back of the elevated level of oil prices. Whilst respending of oil revenues is likely to rise as a result, it will not be sufficient to reduce their surplus significantly. Much of the additional revenue accrued is likely to be saved, as appropriate for countries in which oil reserves are being depleted gradually. This is likely to remain particularly relevant beyond the short term, as oil prices are likely to rise as the resource is depleted.</p>

Structural reforms could help to address the underlying determinants of global and euro area external imbalances over the medium term through their impact on national saving and investment rates (OECD, 2011a). In particular, measures to stimulate investment in external surplus economies by reducing product market regulations in sheltered sectors, in conjunction with measures to improve social welfare systems and liberalise financial markets (while ensuring adequate prudential regulation) in non-OECD economies with an external surplus, could help to narrow global imbalances in the years ahead.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-12-n03"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-12-p0153" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A scenario analysis indicates that the necessary fiscal tightening required to stabilise debt-to-GDP ratios in OECD countries by 2025 could reduce the size of global imbalances – measured as the GDP-weighted sum of countries’ ratios of absolute saving-investment gaps to GDP – by almost one-sixth. If, in addition, Japan, Germany and China were to deregulate their product markets, aligning the level of economy-wide product market regulation with OECD best practice, and China were to raise public health spending by 2 percentage points of GDP (in a fiscally neutral way) and liberalise its financial markets, global imbalances could decline by twice as much (OECD, 2011a). Sizable exchange rate change is also incorporated in this scenario.</p></fnote> Likewise, improvements to product and labour market flexibility in the euro area external deficit countries could moreover facilitate the necessary adjustment of the real exchange rate and the internal allocation of resources in these countries (Barnes, 2010). Fiscal consolidation could also help to bring about sizable reductions in
both global and intra-euro area imbalances, with consolidation needs generally larger in external deficit OECD countries than in external surplus ones.</p>

On the upside, the risks are largely economic ones, endogenous to the pace of the expansion. In contrast, on the downside, risks are more diverse, either being endogenous to the pace of the recovery or being associated with the possibility of particular events that could trigger renewed weakness in activity. Finally, some of the risks identified are two-sided. For example, oil prices may rise or fall back during the projection period, and sovereign debt tensions in the euro area may either rise or fade more rapidly than expected. And while the earthquake in Japan and its aftermath represents a negative risk in the short term, further reconstruction packages could hasten the rebound.</p>

This could occur if the future beneficial effects of new reforms on activity and government debt ratios were to be incorporated into forward-looking asset prices, helping to strengthen balance sheets and support aggregate demand, or if reforms helped to improve near-term labour market outcomes. Structural reforms to boost product market competition and depeen financial markets would also boost growth prospects in the non-OECD economies.</p>

As past episodes, such as the first Gulf War in 1990-91, have demonstrated, instability in a major oil producer can quickly lead to a large spike in oil prices, particularly as the short-run price demand and supply elasticities for oil are low and spare capacity can shrink rapidly. This would magnify the adverse effects on incomes and demand of the recent oil price increase (discussed above), whilst intensifying the upward pressures on headline inflation. Heightened geopolitical uncertainty could add to these downside effects and lead to a broader pull-back in risk taking in financial markets. Higher oil prices would also further widen global imbalances, by increasing the already elevated external surpluses of high-saving oil producing economies and possibly place downward pressure on real interest rates by altering the <emphasis emph="italic">ex-ante</emphasis> balance between global saving and investment.</p>

In the near term, activity could moderate sharply if the tightening of monetary conditions over the past year proves to have been more marked than necessary to damp price pressures. Alternatively, if past tightening is insufficient, inflationary pressures are likely to build further, ultimately necessitating strong further policy actions and raising a risk of a much deeper slowdown in the medium term.</p>

Fiscal consolidation is clearly required in both economies given high and rising public debt levels. In the United States, political problems make fiscal policy almost unpredictable. In the near term, should excessively abrupt consolidation be implemented, the recovery could be endangered. In Japan, fiscal policies in the near term are subject to uncertainty about the scale, timing and financing of reconstruction spending; a lack of political consensus on specific measures to employ to attain the goals of the medium-term consolidation plan is a further source of uncertainty. If additional reconstruction packages prove necessary to support the economy, they should be accompanied by clear and detailed communication on the measures to be adopted in the medium-term consolidation plans.</p>

With corrections in many, but not all, housing markets having now occurred, and, in some countries, prices having risen rapidly in the low interest rate environment, the issue of whether prices are now close to another turning point is again of considerable policy interest. For countries in which price corrections are still ongoing, it is useful to explore whether the correction will be completed and recovery will begin. For countries where corrections have been completed, or where corrections did not materialise, it is useful to examine when a (next) peak will be reached.</p>

Indeed, their interaction could trigger a mild stagflation-type outcome in the OECD economies, if further increases in headline inflation from adverse supply-side shocks were to result in inflation expectations becoming unanchored, and damp activity for a prolonged period. For example, further additional increases in oil prices could raise inflation expectations, with the resulting increase in interest rates undermining banking stability and public finances. In such a scenario, output growth would be weaker than projected, and most likely well below trend rates, and inflation would be clearly above the inflation objective of the monetary authorities. It would prove difficult for conventional macroeconomic policies to offer much support in such circumstances.</p>

In the context of the recovery, priority should be given to reforms that offer the most likely prospects of strengthening near-term growth and which help the unemployed remain in close contact with the labour market. Given the backdrop of impaired public finances, reforms should be consistent with the need to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public sector debt dynamics. In so doing, they could result in lower long-term interest rates than would otherwise be the case. In the medium term, successful structural reforms also could yield important fiscal benefits, in addition to the benefits they could have on per capita incomes. Growth-enhancing structural reforms are also needed to moderate external imbalances, both at the global level and within the euro area.</p>

In 2011, in line with government plans, the underlying budget deficit is projected to remain roughly stable in the United States. In Japan, where fiscal developments are surrounded by uncertainty about the scale, timing and financing of reconstruction spending, the OECD’s assumptions imply a modest decline in the underlying balance. By contrast, in the euro area and most other OECD countries sizable consolidation is projected (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDEJFHA"/>).<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-03-n05"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-03-p0180" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> The decomposition of fiscal balances into cyclical and underlying components is subject to heightened uncertainty, however, as the impact of the crisis on potential output remains unclear.</p></fnote> In 2012, given the large degree of political uncertainty about fiscal developments in the United States, the OECD has assumed some tightening (see below), leaving a headline deficit of about 9% of GDP. A modest tightening has also been assumed in Japan, leading to a deficit of around 8¼ per cent. In most other OECD countries underlying balances are projected to improve in 2012, on the basis of official plans, with the budget deficit declining to close to 3% of GDP on average for the OECD area excluding the United States and Japan. Nonetheless, for most OECD countries, general government debt is set to continue drifting up as a proportion of GDP over the next couple of years as a result of large underlying deficits, still moderate economic growth and mounting interest payments.</p>

Shares of these categories vary considerably across the OECD countries (see first figure). Total securities are the largest category for most OECD countries, accounting on average for a half of total financial assets. They include mainly shares and other equity (an average 40% of total assets) and securities other than shares, like bills, bonds and certificates of deposit, whose nominal value is determined on issue (on average 10% of total assets). Following the System of National Accounts (SNA) convention, shares are valued at current market prices, and if those are not available they are estimated. Currency and deposits comprise on average 20% of total assets, while loans – mainly long-term – account on average for 10%. Other assets account on average for 20% of total financial assets. They include primarily financial claims that arise from timing differences between accrued transactions and payments made for items such as taxes, wages, interest, etc. In some countries, trade credits and advances as well as monetary gold and special drawing rights (SDRs) held outside the central bank are also important.<boxnoteref refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs07-n01" format="boxnoteref"/></p>

Accordingly, in 2009 the (unweighted) OECD average of net debt totalled 22% of GDP, while gross debt stood at 72% of GDP. In ten countries net debt was zero or even negative. In part, sizeable asset levels reflect the response to the financial crisis, as financial assets in the government sector increased substantially due to the recapitalisation or take-over of financial institutions. Indeed, financial assets increased by between 10 and 26% of GDP in Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom between 2007 and 2009.</p>

              <p id="OCDEid1296316" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The proceeds from selling financial assets can be used to reduce gross debt, while leaving net debt unchanged. This implies a reduction in debt servicing costs, and possibly reductions in government bond rates, if markets perceive the improvement in the fiscal stance as a marked step towards fiscal sustainability. However, the sale of assets also eliminates income earned on them. The net effect depends, <emphasis emph="italic">inter alia</emphasis>, on the difference between the interest rate paid on debt and the rate of return earned on assets. If the former exceeds the latter, the sale of assets will improve debt dynamics via the net interest payments effect (abstracting from possible effects on GDP that might be associated with asset sales).</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1296325" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">However, selling financial assets might not be desirable or immediately possible given market conditions, the composition of assets and policy objectives. Privatisation programmes should be based on cost-benefit analysis, taking into account existing market failures in the sectors involved and the potential for absorbing sales without excessive discounts, rather than be driven solely by debt-reduction objectives. In some cases, reserves have been built to cover future implicit liabilities related to pensions and thus should not be liquidated. Also, from a debt management perspective it may be prudent to hold assets as a cushion. In addition, it may take time before long-term loans are paid back. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the scope of asset sales, although in several countries the governments’ equity participations in banks are likely to be unwound over time. As a stylised illustration, the table below shows gross debt reductions, for countries with debt exceeding 75% of GDP in 2009 or being fiscally stressed, that would prevail if all securities, or all shares, were sold (Japan is not included due to missing data). For most countries, such sales would not be enough to reduce gross debt to pre-crisis (2007) levels. The situation is even worse when assessed on the basis of 2010 data, with gross debt in many of these countries estimated to have increased by more than assets.</p>

              <p id="OCDEid1297738" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The scope for reducing gross debt would widen if non-financial assets were taken into consideration as well. They usually include residential and non-residential buildings, machinery and equipment (classified as tangible fixed assets), copyrights, patents, computer software (intangible fixed assets) and land (tangible non-produced assets). Data coverage is however very patchy across countries and across specific asset categories, as many governments do not have an appropriate inventory and the valuation of these assets at market prices is challenging. For those countries which publish complete data on non-financial assets (including Australia, the Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom), these assets are much larger than financial assets. Clearly, as with financial assets, not all of them could and should be for sale. However, continuing fiscal stress in many OECD countries should be taken as an opportunity to evaluate if such assets should be sold. Greece is an example in this regard. Under the financial aid agreement, the Greek government has committed to compile a fixed-asset inventory and implement a privatisation and real estate development programme worth 50 billion euro (22% of 2010 GDP).

However, this box shows that in current circumstances higher inflation would not make significant inroads into high debt burdens, and could have negative side effects.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-06-p0199" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Higher inflation lowers the debt level in real terms but it also increases the nominal cost of debt servicing when nominal interest rates are rising with inflation. The latter effect is stronger with a higher debt turnover (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e.</emphasis> shorter maturity). Whether the real cost of debt servicing rises or falls depends on whether nominal interest rates increase by more or less than inflation.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-06-p0200" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The first table below illustrates how the debt ratio changes with higher inflation given different debt turnover assumptions. This exercise assumes a permanent inflation increase of 1 percentage point which is immediately and fully reflected in all nominal interest rates. The calculations are done for a stylised economy that has initial debt and asset ratios of 100% and 25% respectively, with a real rate of growth and inflation in the baseline of 2%, and the cost of debt at 4% (see notes under the table). These parameters are stylised but correspond to projected characteristics of many OECD countries in the current decade. The assumed different debt repayment profiles attempt to reflect varied maturity structures in the OECD countries (see second table). For the sake of simplicity, the primary balance and the maturity structure do not react to higher inflation.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-06-p0201" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In this setup, the inflation shock lowers the debt ratio after ten years by between 5 percentage points (with high debt turnover) and 9 percentage points (with low debt turnover). This result is primarily driven by the decline in the real stock of debt and the delayed pass-through of higher nominal interest rates to the actual cost of debt, stemming from the assumed debt turnover parameters. It suggests that a sustained increase in inflation by 2 percentage points would be required over a 10-year period to erode the average crisis-induced increase in the debt ratio in the OECD area, which totalled around 20 percentage points between 2007 and 2010.</p>

              <p id="OCDEid1301754" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">While there are economic benefits from lower real debt, resorting to higher inflation also involves many potential adverse effects that are not accounted for in the stylised calculations in the first table. High and persistent inflation could affect macroeconomic stability negatively and damp real growth by raising price and exchange rate volatility, reducing real money balances and increasing the dispersion of relative prices. The precise magnitude of these effects is however uncertain. In such an environment, it is also likely that investors would demand more short-term and inflation–indexed instruments. In some OECD countries, current maturities are already relatively short and the share of inflation-indexed bonds is not negligible (see the second table). In addition, there is large uncertainty regarding the authorities’ capability to generate higher, but still stable, inflation without de-anchoring inflation expectations. With de-anchored inflation expectations, interest rates paid on debt would likely increase more than inflation. Finally, persistent and high inflation may lead to a more widespread use of indexation contracts that are likely to magnify inflation shocks.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1301759" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Overall, the benefits of lower real debt due to higher inflation do not appear large relative to the risks. The effect on debt of a one-percentage-point increase in inflation is limited relative to the size of average indebtedness in the OECD area. Reducing debt ratios to below-crisis levels would require substantially higher rates of inflation, which would likely be associated with more adverse effects on economic activity.</p>

In China, the deficit and debt of the government sector are low. Although off-budget spending by government-backed investment companies expanded sharply during the global slowdown, the government has begun to rein in this form of stimulus. However, the impact on the economy will be offset to some extent by a new subsidised housing programme. Some modest consolidation has taken place in India and continued reductions of high deficits are planned. Consolidation has also been announced in Brazil and the Russian Federation, whereas a broadly neutral fiscal stance is projected for Indonesia and South Africa. </p>

Based on this legislation, the underlying general government deficit is projected to remain roughly unchanged. However, there is no consensus on fiscal consolidation strategies, which casts doubt on the extent to which the President’s budget proposal for next year will be adopted.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-08-n06"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-08-p0210" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The US Congressional Budget Office estimated in March 2011 that the President’s budget proposal would reduce the federal deficit from 9.9% of GDP in 2011 to 7% in 2012 (CBO, 2011). The estimates incorporate the assumption that, as scheduled under current law, the provisions of the 2010 Tax Act terminate in 2012.</p></fnote> Therefore, the projection assumes that the consolidation will amount to 1 percentage point of GDP, following standard procedures used in such circumstances (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs03"/>). This would still leave government finances in a highly unsustainable position, risking serious adverse reactions in financial markets. Hence, a larger degree of fiscal tightening than assumed here would be appropriate, taking into consideration that the economy has yet to fully recover from its cyclical trough. A well articulated medium-term consolidation strategy aimed at putting general government finances on a sustainable path also needs to be agreed as a matter of urgency and with sufficiently wide support to give it credibility. Given the scale of the required consolidation, such a plan would have to include all the big categories of expenditure, notably entitlement spending and defence
outlays as well as revenue increases. In view of the rapid rise of public debt and the need to make plans credible, any plan should contain up-front measures.</p>

Towards this end, the FMS calls for keeping central government primary spending (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>excluding debt repayments and interest) in FY 2011-13 below the initial budget for FY 2010, and limiting bond issuance in FY 2011-12 to that in FY 2010. The initial reconstruction package announced by the government in April 2011 is worth 4 trillion yen (0.8% of GDP). Subsequent packages are expected later in FY 2011. If introduced, these could provide a near-term boost to the economy. The measures in the initial reconstruction package are to be financed without additional borrowing, in line with the authorities’ intentions of maintaining an unchanged level of bond issuance in FY 2011, largely by using budgetary reserves. Such a strategy is necessary in view of the serious fiscal situation, with gross debt at 200% of GDP in 2010. While Japan’s reliance on domestic financial investors, which hold some 95% of government debt, reduces the risk of a run-up in the risk premia on sovereign debt, weakening sovereign bond ratings point to increasing market concerns about the sustainability of the fiscal position. Even without additional borrowing to fund reconstruction expenditure, general government gross debt is projected to reach 219% of GDP in 2012. A more detailed medium-term consolidation plan, identifying the revenue and spending components to be employed to attain the stated targets, therefore needs to be elaborated urgently to put general government finances on a sustainable path. The medium-term consolidation plans should aim at a primary budget surplus that is large enough to stabilise the debt ratio rather
than just a primary budget balance. As stated in OECD (2011b), the consumption tax should be the main source of additional revenue, given that it is low and its impact on economic activity is less negative than other taxes. Tax measures should be accompanied by social security reform that limits spending increases, including in health care, and addresses problems in pensions.</p>

Particular steps that could be taken include raising the retirement age, gradually tightening the eligibility criteria for sickness and disability benefits to exclude them being granted for labour market purposes and, once unemployment begins to fall, reducing disincentives to work embedded in unemployment benefit systems in some countries (notably many continental European economies). Secretariat estimates suggest that a 1 percentage point improvement in potential employment could improve government balances by between 0.3-0.8% of GDP (OECD, 2010).</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-19-p0228" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Some of the consolidation measures being implemented may have beneficial effects on growth. For example, on current plans, outlays for welfare, health care and pensions are most frequently scheduled to be cut (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-19-g024"/>). This may prompt an increase in public sector efficiency and, as discussed above, encourage higher employment levels if designed in a careful way. Cuts in infrastructure investment are also given high priority in consolidation plans, probably reflecting the fact that they are relatively easy to implement. However, there is a risk that the short-term financial gains from cutting infrastructure spending will come at the expense of reducing future potential growth. Growth-friendly cuts in agriculture expenditures, subsidies to state-owned enterprises and energy subsidies are among the least prioritised saving areas for OECD countries, despite sizable support for agriculture, and high levels of subsidies more generally, in many countries. On the revenue side, increases in consumption taxes have been announced most frequently, followed by reductions in tax expenditures (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-19-g025"/>). These are the revenue components that are least likely to have adverse effects on growth.</p>

While the US Federal Reserve has remained in an easing cycle, with the current quantitative easing programme to be completed in June, the European Central Bank has now implemented an initial increase in policy rates, and central banks in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Chile, Israel, Korea, Norway and Sweden, are well into their tightening cycle. This is also the case in many emerging market economies, which exited from the recession much earlier and in which past growth has eliminated most spare capacity and is now generating inflationary pressures. The range of policy measures adopted to manage monetary conditions also remains broad, with many emerging countries using both conventional and unconventional monetary policies, including non-market-based measures, such as reserve requirements and capital controls.</p>

Indeed, given the differences in fiscal policies this year, developments in financial conditions and pre-existing levels of policy interest rates, there could even be grounds for suggesting that policy tightening in the United States should precede that in the euro area.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-22-p0234" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Overall, with the surge in commodity prices and economic recovery gaining momentum, the distribution of risks to inflation has become more balanced in the advanced economies, and there is less need to maintain close-to-zero policy rates for risk management purposes. The risk of deflation appears to have receded significantly and, in the present set of economic projections, inflation is expected to drift up gradually closer to implicit or explicit targets as spare capacity becomes eroded. And with near-term inflation expectations and estimates of break-even inflation rates having risen, there could be even a risk that recent increases in headline inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations, making the rise in headline inflation rates more persistent than would otherwise be the case. Core inflation remains low, but uncertainty about the amount of spare capacity still existing in OECD economies has increased as the recovery has progressed, as discussed above.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-23-p0235" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">This strengthens the argument for an early move to visibly positive, but still low, policy rates, except in Japan and those countries in which policy rates have already been raised. Upside risks to inflation expectations cannot now be excluded, but may be diminished by an early move that makes it easier for rates to be raised subsequently if such risks were to materialise. Equally, if an adverse shock were to occur, it would be preferable to be able to react by reducing policy rates, with fairly certain effects, rather than by renewed quantitative easing. An early move to still-accommodative interest rates would also continue to support demand whilst helping to guard against excessive risk-taking arising from close-to-zero policy rates, and the attendant risks of capital misallocation or a build-up of financial fragilities. Thereafter, the challenge for the monetary authorities will be to judge the pace at which to raise policy rates so as to maintain support for the recovery whilst keeping projected inflation close to implicit or explicit target levels. The existing stock of assets acquired by central banks via quantitative easing programmes should be maintained until policy interest rates are well above current levels. Otherwise, asset sales would be likely to push up longer-term yields to an uncertain extent, creating considerable communication challenges and possibly also the need for offsetting policy rate responses if long-term interest rates were to jump excessively.</p>

The still-elevated rate of unemployment and modest core inflation appear to be consistent with the decision to complete the quantitative easing programme in June. Nevertheless, with some signs that long-term inflation expectations have edged up, there is a strong case for an initial and visibly positive rise in the policy rate from mid-2011, followed later by a gradual reduction in the degree of accommodation as the recovery progresses and the extent of economic slack diminishes. In this set of economic projections, the target Federal Funds rate is assumed to be raised in a series of small steps by 100 basis points in the remainder of this year and, after a pause at this level to assess the impact on the economy, thereafter be increased steadily to reach 2¼ per cent by the end of 2012. Further increases in policy rates towards neutral levels would be likely soon thereafter, with the remaining output gap continuing to be eroded steadily.</p>

In the immediate future, there is little pressure to make additional moves, since, although headline inflation has risen above the ECB’s definition of price stability, core inflation rates are relatively low, especially once indirect tax changes are excluded. Moreover, a visibly positive level of money market interest rates now exists. During 2012, a gradual normalisation of the main policy rate would be warranted. In this set of projections, the main refinancing rate is assumed to be increaseed through 2012 to 2¼ per cent by the end of the year, still providing considerable stimulus in the context of remaining large, but increasingly uncertain, economic slack.</p>

On a conceptual level, the Swiss and US currency unions raise the same question as to whether a single monetary policy can fit all cantons and states. In practice, the difference is considerable because Swiss cantons and US states have a sizeable central government able to manage fiscal transfers and labour, services and financial markets that are much more integrated. </p></fnote> For the fragile financial systems in the latter countries, one option would be for the ECB to maintain special liquidity supports whilst raising policy rates (Minegishi and Cournède, 2010). At the same time, authorities in the larger countries should consider using macro-prudential tools to deal with excessively strong, country-specific asset-price growth, should it materialise. Over the medium term structural reforms in all euro area countries are necessary to enhance economic integration, thus increasing the benefits of the monetary union.</p>

If the recent increases in long-term inflation expectations were allowed to become entrenched, the Bank of England could face difficulty in curbing the consumer price inflation rate. The Bank of England should therefore start to raise the policy rate soon, with the subsequent pace of monetary policy normalisation depending on the projected impact of strong fiscal consolidation on the economy and the speed at which economic slack is eroded. In the projections, policy rates are assumed to be raised to 1% by the end of 2011, and to then, after a pause, be raised gradually during 2012 to around 2¼ per cent by the end of the year.</p>

It also decided to supply longer-tem funds amounting to 1 trillion yen (0.2% of GDP) to financial institutions in disaster areas in order to support reconstruction efforts, and raised the size of the asset purchase programme from 5 to 10 trillion yen. Going forward, the current zero interest rate policy needs to be continued until inflation is firmly positive, especially given the uncertainty about the effect of the earthquake on economic slack. In the absence of signs of a clear trend toward achieving the 1% implicit inflation target, the Bank of Japan should stand ready to undertake further measures, focusing on reducing long-term interest rates through expanded purchases of government bonds. The first policy rate increase can wait until 2013 or later, occurring only when inflation is clearly set to reach about 1%. The potential accumulation of financial imbalances that could result from very low interest rates has to be monitored closely, but the Bank should be patient because of the risk of losing credibility in the event of having to return to zero interest rates soon after a premature policy rate increase.</p>

In China, where inflation has become markedly more entrenched in recent months, loan and deposit rates and the reserve requirement ratio have already been raised and the real exchange rate is now appreciating as a result of higher inflation. With output growth easing to below trend rates, and thus closing the positive output gap, only modest further tightening may be needed this year to stabilise underlying inflation, with the priority being given to market-based measures rather than reserve requirements. Allowing an appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate would also help to reduce inflationary pressures. In India, the annual rate of inflation remains high and is becoming more widespread. Further policy tightening is warranted to help contain demand pressures and reduce the risk of inflation expectations becoming destabilised. In Brazil, with still-strong credit growth, continued capacity constraints and inflation now at the upper bound of the target range, tightening policies are warranted through higher policy rates and adequate micro and macro-prudential measures. Fiscal tightening would reduce the size of any required policy rate increases in both Brazil and India.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-31-p0244" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Many emerging market economies continue to face large capital inflows. These can pose considerable policy challenges for host economies, given the associated risks of excessive currency appreciation, asset price and credit booms and busts, and sudden stops. In the longer term, as discussed in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>, financial market deepening and other growth-friendly structural reforms can affect net international asset positions and help achieve a better composition of inflows, with more FDI and less debt, providing a defence against the negative effects of strong, speculative capital inflows. They can also ensure that domestic credit is intermediated effectively. But such reforms take time to put in place. In the near term, macroeconomic policies have an important role to play, though the extent to which they can be used will likely vary across countries. As mentioned above, allowing an exchange rate appreciation would help to contain any inflationary pressures arising from inflows and also reduce the incentives for further inflows. If accompanied by fiscal consolidation, there would be greater scope to loosen monetary policy, which would also damp inflows. Micro and macro-prudential policies should also have a key role, both in limiting excessive risk-taking and in tackling risks in particular sectors or asset classes. Other possible policy options in the near-term include reserve accumulation, via foreign exchange intervention, and other measures to damp capital inflows such as taxes on inflows or direct capital controls. As discussed in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>, reserve accumulation is costly, often inefficient, and should normally not be pursued for prolonged periods. Capital controls could prove effective in the near term in helping to damp potential financial vulnerabilities from large
capital inflows, but are best seen as a temporary solution, so as to minimise distortions to longer-term investments, and preferably should be subject to multilateral surveillance within a framework provided by the OECD Code of Liberalisation of Capital Movements.</p>

Compared with the 2010 EU-wide stress test, which failed to uncover vulnerabilities in some countries, the planned 2011 stress test will have a more demanding capital threshold based on Core Tier 1 capital instead of Tier 1 capital (which includes hybrid capital) and greater macroeconomic stress (though relative to a stronger baseline scenario). However, the adverse scenario regrettably excludes haircuts on sovereign debt held on banking books, which remains a sizeable risk.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-32-n11"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-32-p0246" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See also Blundell-Wignall and Slovik (2010).</p></fnote> Ahead of the publication of the results, euro area governments have committed to prepare specific strategies to restructure vulnerable institutions. Such backstop strategies should increase confidence in the tests. In the longer term, the priority should be to encourage market discipline, for which supervisory stress tests can be only an imperfect substitute. Key measures to progress in the direction of this objective include addressing the <shortcitation>too-big-to-fail</shortcitation> problem, strengthening bank resolution regimes and improving bank information disclosures.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-33-p0247" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> Looking further ahead, the implementation of the recently agreed Basel III capital requirements will strengthen bank loss-absorption capacity. Estimates in Slovik and Cournède (2011) suggest that in the three main OECD economies, banks may raise their target capital ratios by at least 3.7 percentage points, reducing the annual rate of GDP growth by 0.05 to 0.15 percentage point (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDIFBIE"/>). The introduction of countercyclical buffers during the credit cycle could further strengthen the long-term resilience of the banking sector (Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, 2010). However, it is as yet undecided at the global level, if and how, required capital ratios will be increased for systemically important financial institutions to reflect their greater risk-taking on the back of explicit government guarantees (Blundell-Wignall<emphasis emph="italic"> et al., </emphasis>2010). Some countries have already introduced or are considering specific capital requirements for systemically important banks (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Switzerland and the United Kingdom<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-33-n12"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-33-p0248" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See the Independent Commission on Banking (2011).</p></fnote>), not only to address the <shortcitation> too-big-to-fail</shortcitation> problem, but also in recognition of the fact that, especially in small countries such as Switzerland that host very large financial institutions, some may be too big to save. The planned introduction of a binding leverage coverage ratio is particularly important for systemically important institutions, as these tend to be more leveraged than others.</p>

In practice, however, even under Basel III and additional national capital regimes, the equity cushion is unlikely to be large enough to secure continued liquidity at all times.<fnote id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-34-n13"><p id="o12-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-34-p0251" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Until banks started benefitting from gradually expanding government backing from the middle of the 19<specchar position="sup" font="default">th</specchar> century, they typically maintained capital positions above or close to 50% to convince depositors and lenders that their investments were safe.</p></fnote> Against this background, the Basel III framework will include liquidity requirements aimed at improving individual banks’ resilience to liquidity shocks. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio will require banks to hold the minimum level of high-quality liquid assets necessary to withstand an adverse liquidity stress scenario lasting for one month. The Net Stable Funding Ratio is a structural measure that requires banks to rely on stable medium to long-term funding instead of short-term money market financing. Although these requirements reduce the vulnerability of banks to liquidity risk, some concerns remain about their implementation. The liquidity requirements in their current form put a lot of emphasis on government bonds although recent developments have underscored that the safety and liquidity of government bonds cannot be taken for granted. The liquidity and stable funding requirements may also create incentives for regulatory arbitrage between different asset classes, as was the case with risk-weighted regulation in the run-up to the current financial crisis. Moreover, since the banking sector will require large amounts of medium to long-term funding, there is a risk
that asset-liability maturity mismatches may emerge and create vulnerabilities elsewhere in the financial system. These caveats suggest that liquidity regulation should: avoid assuming that domestic government bonds are necessarily always fully liquid, especially for members of a currency union; rely on simple rules rather than overly complicated weighting schemes that could open new avenues for regulatory arbitrage; and be accompanied by adequate supervision of other parts of the financial system, including insurance companies, where potentially destabilising asset-liability mismatches could migrate to.</p>

The efforts to move most trading in derivatives to public exchanges or at least central clearing houses should be completed rapidly. Effective cross-border resolution regimes also need to be put in place for large global banks to reduce the moral hazard created by a situation where they cannot be closed without destabilising repercussions. Further international convergence in accounting rules, especially for financial institutions, remains important to facilitate the implementation of global regulatory standards, particularly leverage caps. Furthermore, as mentioned above in the case of liquidity but also more generally, regulation and supervision must effectively cover areas, such as insurance and pensions, where vulnerabilities and systemic risk could migrate as a result of tighter banking regulation.</p>

Both types of policy are likely to respond to aggregate demand shocks in a similar manner, but this may not be the case for aggregate supply shocks. And, if macro-prudential policies are impaired for any reason, or not yet fully in place, monetary policy may need to place greater weight on financial stability issues than would otherwise be merited. Equally, if policy interest rates are at the zero bound, macro-prudential policies might have to place greater weight on their macroeconomic effects than would otherwise be the case (Yellen, 2010).</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Supported by accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions the economy continues to recover gradually from the recession that ended a year and a half ago. Nevertheless, the adverse effects of the crisis are still being felt, particularly in the form of still-high unemployment. Output growth should gain speed and the unemployment rate should continue to decline through 2012 though the pace of expansion will be limited by household deleveraging and initial steps at fiscal consolidation.</emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The Federal Reserve should continue to support growth, as the economy lingers below capacity and core inflation remains low, but a modest reduction in monetary stimulus starting in the second half of this year would reduce the likelihood of a potentially destabilising rapid increase in interest rates later. With very large budget deficits and fast-rising federal debt, an agreement on a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation programme will become increasingly urgent as the economy continues to recover.</emphasis>

          <p id="ID-42-1056002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Budget positions are poor at all levels of government, owing to both the effect of the recession and weak positions prior to it. Government support for economic growth is winding down and deficit reduction is likely to begin later this year. The general government deficit is assumed to fall from 10½ per cent of GDP in 2010 to 9 per cent in 2012. This is a much more moderate pace of fiscal consolidation than currently suggested by government plans, but has been assumed given the lack of political consensus on how to cut the deficit. Further progress to unwind fiscal imbalances beyond 2012 would require ambitious reforms of the tax system and entitlement spending, along the lines recommended by the President’s Fiscal Commission in late 2010.</p>

          </heading>
          <p id="ID-42-1056022" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Substantial slack in the economy, relatively low levels of inflation, subdued bank lending and the prospect that banks will have to meet stricter capital standards under Basel III all imply that, monetary policy should remain accommodative for the foreseeable future. At present, there is little sign that continued extraordinarily loose macroeconomic policy settings have increased inflation expectations more than a small amount or are resulting in another asset price bubble (with the possible exception of oil and other commodities), though such outcomes remain a risk. Even so, a modest reduction in monetary stimulus should get underway in the second half of this year following the ending of the second round of quantitative easing in June. Tightening somewhat now would reduce the need for steeper, and potentially disruptive, increases in interest rates later, smoothing the transition to neutral rates as the recovery matures.</p>

The current account deficit is likely to continue to increase somewhat as consumption and investment rise, but the increase should be attenuated by the fall in the value of the dollar and the overall balance should remain much improved from its pre-recession levels.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The 11 March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake triggered the country’s worst disaster of the post-war era. The immediate impact has been to reduce output, although this is likely to be reversed by a strong recovery in the second half of 2011 led by reconstruction efforts. However, deflationary pressures are likely to continue through 2012, with unemployment remaining above its pre-2008 crisis level.</emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Reconstruction spending in areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami will be significant given the scale of destruction. With public debt exceeding 200% of GDP, it is important to finance reconstruction spending by shifting expenditures and increasing revenues. A detailed and credible fiscal consolidation programme, including tax increases and spending cuts large enough to achieve the government’s target of stabilising the public debt ratio by 2020, is a priority. The Bank of Japan should maintain an accommodative stance until underlying inflation is firmly positive.</emphasis>

By early 2011, the unemployment rate had fallen to 4½ per cent, down from its record high of 5.4% in mid-2009, and the decline in the core consumer price index had slowed to 0.6% (year-on-year) from 1.5% in mid-2010.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056293" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The Great East Japan Earthquake claimed around 25 000 lives and caused damage to social infrastructure, housing and private firms’ fixed capital that has been initially estimated by the government at between 3.3% and 5.2% of 2010 GDP. Moreover, significant damage to nuclear and thermal power plants reduced the electricity supply and created concern about radiation from the Fukushima plant. The disaster also disrupted supply chains, reducing output in parts of Japan that were not hit by the earthquake and tsunami, contributing to a 15% decline in industrial production (seasonally-adjusted, month-on-month) in March, the largest ever recorded. Consequently, the Bank of Japan’s April report downgraded its assessment of seven of Japan’s nine regional economies. The disaster also had an immediate impact on business and consumer confidence, which recorded its largest drop on record in March, as did the <shortcitation>Economy Watchers</shortcitation> index, which surveys workers whose jobs are sensitive to changes in the economy, such as taxi drivers and shop clerks. Car sales plummeted by 37% (year-on-year) in March. The disaster caused a large contraction in output in the first quarter of 2011.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056458" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The initial reconstruction package approved in May 2011 amounts to 4 trillion yen (0.8%) of GDP. It will be financed without additional borrowing, in line with the government’s goal of restricting bond issuance in FY 2011 to its FY 2010 level of 44 trillion yen (9% of GDP). Instead, it will be funded primarily by diverting the central government’s 2.5 trillion yen contribution to the basic pension system to reconstruction efforts and by reserves in the FY 2011 budget. The government’s budget deficit is projected to remain above 9% of GDP (excluding one-off factors) in 2011. While this financing plan avoids an increase in gross debt, it implies a reduction in government assets, thus boosting net debt. Additional reconstruction spending packages are expected in FY 2011, in line with the experience of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, which was followed by three supplementary budgets within one year. Even without additional reconstruction spending, gross government debt is projected to reach 219% of GDP in 2012, pushing Japan’s public finances farther into uncharted territory. </p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056479" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The Bank of Japan reacted promptly following the disaster by providing liquidity on a large scale to stabilise financial markets. In addition, the Bank announced that it would double the size of its asset purchase programme to 10 trillion yen (2% of GDP) to prevent a deterioration in business sentiment and an increase in risk aversion. The authorities also intervened in foreign exchange markets in March as part of a multilateral commitment by the G7 countries to curb excess exchange rate volatility. This joint intervention immediately reduced the currency’s value relative to the dollar, which had risen to a record high, to around its pre-earthquake level and prompted a recovery in equity prices.</p>

          </heading>
          <p id="ID-42-1056499" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The experience of past disasters in Japan and other developed countries suggests that the large negative impact on economic output in the first half of 2011 will be followed by a rebound as reconstruction spending picks up. In addition to public outlays, business and residential investment will increase as firms and households replace fixed capital and housing damaged in the disaster. In contrast to fixed investment, private consumption is projected to remain relatively subdued during 2011, reflecting weaker household confidence, as occurred following the Kobe earthquake. However, as residential investment gains momentum, private consumption, particularly for consumer durables, is likely to strengthen. These factors imply growth running at an average rate of around 4½ per cent during the second half of 2011. As public and private investment moderate following the completion of the 4 trillion yen initial package, the pace of output growth may slow to close to 1% by the end of 2012, leaving a large negative output gap. Consequently, headline inflation, which is likely to be positive in 2011 as a result of rising oil and commodity prices and the dislocations related to the disaster, may return to negative territory in 2012. The current account surplus is projected to fall from 3.6% of GDP in 2010 to around 2½ per cent in 2011-12, partly reflecting increased imports of oil to temporarily replace nuclear power. </p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056519" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The extent of the damage from this unprecedented disaster in Japan and its economic impact will only become fully apparent in the months to come. There is great uncertainty, notably as regards the duration of electricity shortages and the problems at the Fukushima nuclear plant. In addition, the pace of government reconstruction spending, as well as the size and financing of future fiscal packages, will have an important impact on the path of the economy. Consequently, the timing and strength of an economic rebound is exceptionally difficult to project. In addition, there are risks related to developments in the world economy, exchange rates and commodity prices. The delay in fiscal consolidation and continuing rise in the public debt ratio also increase the risk of a run-up in long-term interest rates.</p>

The pace of recovery is likely to be dampened by required fiscal consolidation, on-going private sector balance sheet adjustment and higher energy prices. Headline inflation has risen sharply due to energy price increases and higher indirect taxes, but underlying price pressures remain weak, reflecting high unemployment and significant spare capacity. The sovereign debt crisis and persisting imbalances within the euro area are a major risk to the outlook.</emphasis>

More credible and detailed multi-year budget plans need to be put in place. Strengthening EU and national fiscal institutions, including through proposed reforms, would help. Monetary policy stimulus should gradually be withdrawn once underlying inflationary pressures begin to emerge. Reforms of labour and product markets are needed to facilitate economic rebalancing and to boost long-term growth. Together with reforms of fiscal and macro-prudential policies, structural reforms would make the euro area more resilient.</emphasis>

          <p id="ID-42-1055971" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Headline annual inflation rose to 2.8% in April from 1.9% six months previously. The sharp increase was primarily due to a jump in energy prices. Over the past year, unusually large increases in indirect tax rates have contributed strongly to inflation. By contrast, annual inflation excluding food and energy prices, and at constant tax rates, has remained weak, consistent with the large degree of economic slack. Nominal hourly labour costs increased by just 1.6% during 2010 and available information on negiotated wages suggests further moderation in the short term. Inflation is likely to pick up only slowly, and the large degree of remaining slack suggests that the energy price increases will not trigger pronounced second-round effects.</p>

The ECB’s main refinancing rate was increased by 25 basis points to 1.25% in April, while short-term interbank rates have been on a rising trend as a result of expectations of future rate rises and greater convergence of market rates with the policy rate. Three-month refinancing operations allocated with full allotment will continue, at least for the coming months. The euro effective exchange rate has appreciated modestly over recent months. Provided that the recovery continues and that underlying inflationary pressures remain weak, monetary policy stimulus should be withdrawn only gradually, and further increases in policy rates are not required immediately. Non-standard measures should continue to be wound down as conditions allow.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The euro area government debt-to-GDP ratio is rising and passed 90% of GDP during 2010. Structural deficits must be brought down so that the debt burden can be stabilised and then reduced to more prudent levels. Fiscal consolidation is now underway in all countries, with consolidation particularly marked in countries with stabilisation programmes. Prolonged consolidation and tight public finances will be required for many years in numerous countries to meet the 60% ceiling set out in the Stability and Growth Pact. More credible and detailed multi-year plans need to be put in place. The commitment to consolidation would be enhanced by reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact and to national fiscal institutions, including by implementing and going beyond proposed reforms to the Pact. The agreed quantitative standard for debt reduction may help, but its effectiveness risks being undermined by the inclusion of other factors.The creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has the potential to add to stability both in the near and longer term, although its credibility requires that banking system exposure to governments is well managed.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056032" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The recovery is projected to continue to gain strength during 2011 and 2012. Consumption will accelerate as improving labour market conditions, low interest rates and higher confidence reduce saving, offsetting the headwinds from pressures on real disposable income due to tax increases and energy prices. Private non-residential investment will bounce back as growth prospects improve and spare capacity is gradually absorbed, assisted by more favourable financial conditions. Export growth will remain strong as export markets grow, even if the rate of expansion eases modestly and the effects of the stronger euro are felt. However, the required fiscal consolidation implies only very modest growth in government spending over the forecast horizon. Growth will also be held back by on-going balance sheet adjustment and rebalancing of demand in several countries. The growth rate of potential output, in the absence of further major structural reforms, would be lower than in previous recoveries, continuing past trends in productivity growth and reflecting the impact of demographic ageing.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056052" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The euro area is sensitive to uncertainty around future energy prices and world trade following in the wake of the earthquake in Japan. Risks around the pace of the recovery in domestic demand remain substantial but broadly balanced. The recovery in consumption and business investment could be stronger than anticipated, although weakness in countries undergoing difficult adjustment could be greater than foreseen. Remaining imbalances within the euro area and a disorderly unwinding of economic and financial imbalances in the context of the sovereign debt crisis pose major risks to the outlook. Weaknesses in government and bank solvency could lead to wider financial tensions and contagion, which would test the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) and the banking system.</p>

Manufacturing orders increased further, with those coming from countries outside the euro area already reaching their pre-crisis levels. Business confidence remains at historically high levels, suggesting that any adverse growth effects from the earthquake in Japan – notably through supply chains – will be limited. As spare capacity is being reduced with the output gap closing fast, firms are increasingly undertaking capital-widening investment. While the currently high inflation rates, boosted by high energy and food prices, may hamper private consumption, higher but still moderate wage settlements and continued employment gains are likely to foster spending by households.</p>

This suggests that past labour market reforms that raised employment incentives continue to enhance labour market performance. Indeed, the structural unemployment rate is estimated to have kept falling throughout the crisis. However, with unemployment continuing to fall, the labour market is getting tighter and labour shortages are beginning to emerge in some sectors. This will lead to wage pressure and compensation per employee is projected to rise by around 3% in 2012, the highest rate since the mid-1990s. As a consequence, core inflation is likely to increase even as headline inflation falls back as the impact of energy and food price increases fades out.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056926" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In 2010, the fiscal deficit was little changed as cyclical improvements, helped by one-off measures (such as the proceeds from a mobile phone frequency auction) almost fully offset expenditure increasing measures worth around 1% of GDP. At 3.3% of GDP, general government net lending in 2010 was by far the lowest among G7 countries. With continued above-trend growth and consolidation measures worth about 0.5% of GDP a year through 2014, the deficit is set to fall further. This consolidation is appropriate and well-timed given the cyclical position of the economy and is needed to meet the constitutional fiscal rule. Some of the announced measures, however, still need to be further specified. Despite the relatively good deficit position, public debt increased sharply in 2010 to over 80% of GDP, mostly reflecting the government’s assumption of risk assets and liabilities in connection with the setting up of resolution agencies for some banks. Financing this additional debt burden coupled with the rise in government bond yields will raise interest expenditures by around 0.3% of GDP. These developments, and the prospect of higher ageing-related spending, underline the necessity to keep public finances on a prudent track.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1056946" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The economy is projected to continue growing significantly above its potential growth rate (estimated at around 1½ per cent) in both 2011 and 2012. Growth will be boosted by the ECB monetary conditions, which are too loose given the rise in Germany’s nominal GDP. In particular investment spending, including residential investment, benefits from the current situation that is expected to prevail over the projection horizon. Even though quarterly growth in the remainder of 2011 will slow somewhat from the buoyant level in the first quarter, annual average growth is projected to reach around 3½ per cent. The main contributions will come from both investment spending, as firms expand capacity in view of the closing output gap, and exports, due to continued strong growth in the main export partners. Private consumption growth is also projected to accelerate, in particular once headline inflation rates decrease. In 2012, domestic demand is projected to contribute two-thirds to overall GDP growth of 2½ per cent on a working-day adjusted basis (annual growth in non-adjusted terms will be 2¼ per cent).</p>

On the negative side, export growth could be weaker, possibly related to a further rise in commodity and energy prices hampering world trade. Higher inflation would further dent real disposable income of households and, thus, consumption growth. A deterioration of financial conditions or the situation in the banking sector, potentially related to a government debt restructuring in the euro area periphery, would hurt investment. On the positive side, private consumption could grow more rapidly if household income grew more rapidly than projected or if consumers became more confident and lower their saving rate.</p>

Beyond 2014, the more ambitious objective of eliminating the deficit entirely is called for in order to bring down debt at an appropriate pace.</p>

Other actions include a public sector pay freeze, the non-replacement of half of all retiring workers in central government, an increase in capital gains taxation and a new tax on banks. Broadly in line with government objectives, the projection assumes a further reduction in the total deficit from 5.6% in 2011 to 4.6% of GDP in 2012; however, the precise steps that will bring it about should be spelt out quickly. As France is entering a pre-election period, uncertainty as to the achievement of planned consolidation is increasing.</p>

Extending the General Public Policy Review to all levels of public administration and shrinking programmes that are not cost effective will be key. Consolidation of small municipalities and elimination of departments could generate substantial economies of scale. Considerable savings could be made without impairing the quality of the health-care system by reducing the frequency and length of stays in hospitals, lowering administrative costs and expanding the use of generic drugs and capitation-based physician compensation. To the extent increased revenues are needed, tax expenditures should be cut further, including on saving schemes. Also, raising taxes on environmental externalities, such as carbon emissions, as well as others that are the least distortive – in particular, taxes on property and the VAT – should be considered.</p>

A stronger fiscal framework – consisting of a structural deficit rule, detailed multi-year budgeting and an independent fiscal council through a constitutional reform – could lock in the political commitment and anchor long-term credibility. Structural reforms that boost employment and bolster growth would also greatly contribute to restoring public finances.

Private investment and exports should be buoyant, helped by accommodative credit conditions and robust global activity, including stronger German domestic demand. Unfortunately, the unemployment rate is likely to decline only moderately, while price pressures will remain subdued, with underlying inflation remaining well below 2%. With indebted owner-occupier households in a healthy solvency position, there is no need for major deleveraging. Private consumption should thus continue to be supportive, with the saving rate easing to its pre-crisis level as lower joblessness and a shrinking public deficit work to restore household confidence. Given the waning terms-of-trade deterioration, the current account deficit should plateau at around 2.6% of GDP.</p>

This requires, as assumed in the present projections, continued tight control of expenditure and further improvements in tax collection. Such vigilance is necessary because of the high debt-to-GDP ratio, even though this is set to decline in 2012, and the likely increase in the cost of debt service as long-term interest rates climb in the medium term.

The strong growth in industrial production of the first half of 2010 gave way to a period of sluggish performance through the winter months, as investment demand may have been damped by the ending of fiscal incentives in mid-2010 and production in important partner countries was cut by severe weather. Even so, imports and exports grew much faster than overall domestic activity. In the year to February 2011, growth in goods export volumes considerably outpaced that of imports, though falling terms of trade, as oil and other commodity prices rose substantially, kept the balance of trade in deficit.</p>

Above-target inflation, driven by tax increases and commodity prices, and needed fiscal consolidation, will hold back private consumption and public spending during 2011-12. Inflation will remain above the 2% target through 2011 and most of 2012, but is set to fall when the effects of the tax increases and rising import prices wane.

Further reforms to improve public sector efficiency and increasing the effective retirement age would mitigate fiscal pressures. Monetary policy should remain expansionary over the forecast period to support activity in view of the tightening fiscal stance.

Notwithstanding fiscal consolidation, domestic demand will pick up, though only slowly, as business investment rises and, once inflation subsides, household consumption strengthens. Exports have risen significantly but continue to underperform relative to other OECD countries despite a significant depreciation of the pound, reflecting limited improvements in relative export prices and still falling financial service exports. Employment started to rise during 2010, but rising labour force participation due to demographic factors has left the unemployment rate virtually unchanged since mid-2009 at slightly below 8%.</p>

The government intends to achieve a cyclically adjusted current balance (that is, excluding net public investment) by the end of the 2015/16 budget year. The planned annual fiscal contraction between 2010 and 2012, which is built into these projections, amounts to roughly 1.6% of GDP. The fiscal deficit is projected by the OECD to fall to 7.1% of GDP in 2012, while gross public debt is expected to reach 93% of GDP.</p>

Consolidation is set out in terms of reaching a cyclically-adjusted current balance, thus allowing the automatic stabilisers to operate. Nevertheless, consolidation measures should be implemented in a way that minimises the detrimental impact on short-term growth. Ending exemptions and increasing lower rates in the VAT system would increase efficiency and raise revenues that could be used to lessen cuts in infrastructure investment. Structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and further increasing the effective retirement age, on top of the planned increase in the state pension age, would also ease long-term fiscal pressures.</p>

Public consumption and investment are set to fall significantly, while household consumption is expected to stay subdued, reflecting falling real incomes and stagnant asset prices. Further increases in exports, supported by rising global demand, the low exchange rate and a fading drag from financial service exports will eventually underpin a somewhat stronger recovery in 2012. Business investment has fallen to low levels and will gather further pace in 2012, partly in response to rising exports. With weak domestic demand, imports will grow slowly and the current account deficit is expected to narrow through 2012.</p>

This is appropriate as inflation is expected to fall in 2012. Nevertheless, a modest increase in interest rates should be taken during 2011 to stave off increases in inflation expectations, which are already elevated. As the recovery gathers momentum in 2012, the pace of normalisation of interest rates should be stepped up. A winding-down of quantitative easing should commence once policy rates have increased measurably, probably later than 2012.</p>

The fall in household disposable incomes may bear down more on consumption than projected. Risks to the export sector are significant on both sides of the baseline projection.

Manufacturing activity has begun to expand rapidly following a sharp inventory drawdown at the end of 2010, and industrial capacity utilisation has been gradually increasing for several quarters. Strengthening business-sector confidence, credit growth and profitability are progressively returning private non-residential investment towards pre-recession levels. While the unemployment rate and average hours worked have yet to fully recover, employment has risen substantially, particularly in full-time and private-sector work. This, along with terms-of-trade gains, has bolstered household income and underpinned consumption spending. Government consumption and investment under the fiscal stimulus programme also continued to contribute significantly to growth in the final half of 2010. Export volumes rebounded vigorously at end-2010, buoyed by a firming global appetite for Canadian commodities and some temporary factors, but have moderated in early-2011.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1058921" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Robust growth in emerging market economies combined with a number of supply shocks have driven up the world price of commodities, boosting the terms of trade and demand for exports. A recovering US economy is expected to reinforce the profile of exports, although the high value of the Canadian dollar should continue to depress profitability and international competitiveness in the export-oriented manufacturing sector. Given relatively sluggish labour productivity, the languid performance of non-commodity exports in world markets is likely to persist. Providing some offset, the strong exchange rate should nevertheless lower the cost of imported machinery and equipment and encourage capital spending. With firms benefiting from improving credit conditions, sound financial health and lower tax rates, business investment should remain an important driver of growth. Investment intentions appear especially strong in the energy sector, which is enjoying high world prices.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1058941" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The shift to fiscal contraction, and in particular the trimming of public-sector compensation, will weigh on household income. Household debt inched up to a record 149% of disposable income in the last half of 2010, continuing its longer-term upward trend. Although deleveraging needs are not as severe as in some other OECD countries that experienced housing booms, substantial debt burdens should nonetheless damp consumer spending in the near term. Indeed, growth in consumer and mortgage credit has already eased substantially since mid-2010. The higher purchasing power afforded by the strong exchange rate is not expected to affect consumption growth significantly, given that households are simultaneously facing higher food and energy bills as a result of soaring world commodity prices. Consumers are unlikely to be able to rely on further significant increases in house prices to improve their balance sheets. House prices are already high relative to incomes and rents, and the market appears to have stabilised and may cool. In particular, in mid-March a new set of changes tightening mortgage insurance regulations came into effect (the third since October 2008), including a shortening in the maximum amortisation period by an additional five years.</p>

The draft 2011-12 pre-election federal budget included some new spending measures, funded by greater-than-expected revenues in 2010 and a stronger growth outlook. The projection assumes that consolidation is implemented as planned, and that the total government deficit will fall from 5.5% of GDP in 2010 to 3.5% in 2012. However, achieving these plans will require significant expenditure restraint compared to the previous decade, which will entail curbing public-sector compensation and defence spending. At the provincial level, priorities should include achieving operational efficiencies in health care and providing details on other planned measures based on strategic reviews, which are underway.</p>

While year-on-year core inflation rose to 1.7% in the same month, continued, if narrowing, economic slack suggests it will remain subdued. Nonetheless, monetary policy remains highly stimulative despite indications that short-term inflation expectations have begun creeping upwards in recent quarters. The Bank of Canada should therefore resume the normalisation of policy rates soon in order to pre-empt a broadening of inflationary pressures, although tightening should proceed at a moderate pace in light of the simultaneous fiscal contraction.</p>

The natural disaster in Japan should temporarily curb production and trade this spring, particularly in the automotive sector, although this should be offset by a catch-up in activity later in the year. Consumption growth is projected to slow over the remainder of the year as the housing market cools and households rebuild their stretched balance sheets. As firming labour markets support wage growth, consumption should pick up again in 2012. Business investment should remain robust, and exports are projected to contribute more solidly to growth especially as the US recovery strengthens. The output gap should thus narrow significantly over the projection but remain large enough to hold underlying inflation to about 1½ per cent per year.</p>

The widespread fiscal contraction across many advanced economies, and especially in the United States, may weaken external demand more than projected.

Such a scenario could trigger a more marked house price correction that significantly strains household and bank balance sheets. An unexpected decline in commodity prices would have the opposite effects.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1059092" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Growth in the Australian economy slowed in the second half of 2010 to 2½ per cent year-on-year. The economic impact of tighter monetary policy in 2010, the appreciation of the exchange rate, and the gradual withdrawal of the budgetary stimulus was only partially offset by the rebound in private demand buoyed by higher terms-of-trade. In early 2011, the country was hit by major flooding and a cyclone and the economic impact of earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand. These shocks reduced output and demand, particularly exports, cutting GDP by up to 1% in the first quarter.</p>
          <p id="ID-42-1059234" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Despite these disruptions, the business climate remains positive. Mining commodity prices are at historical highs and firms have again revised their investment plans upwards. In contrast, households, whose confidence was declining in early 2011, have continued to rein in consumption and reduce their debts. By April 2011, employment had recovered to pre-disaster levels in the regions most affected by the rains and flooding, and the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.9%. Underlying inflation remained moderate, however, at 2¼ per cent in the first quarter of 2011 because of the easing of demand and the exchange rate appreciation. Headline inflation, pushed by strong rises in fruit and vegetable prices stemming from the recent adverse weather events, rose to 3¼ per cent.</p>

This, together with the exchange rate appreciation, has given monetary policy a slightly restrictive stance. Against this background, demand for credit has remained weak. The current stance of monetary policy seems appropriate. However, inflation pressure might emerge because of potential second-round effects of weather disruptions and of oil price hikes and of the acceleration in growth from the second quarter of this year onward, which could induce bottlenecks in some parts of the economy. </p>

The flooding has generated additional budgetary costs of around ½ per cent of GDP, which will be financed by a temporary increase in direct taxes on middle and high-income households and the cancellation or deferment of some government spending. The 2011/12 Budget confirms the authorities’ commitment to pursue a restrictive fiscal policy to return to surplus by as early as 2013. To this end, budgetary savings amounting 1½ per cent of GDP have been identified over the next 4 years, with the removal of some tax expenditures and a better targeting of family benefits. The budget also includes several measures to promote labour participation and training, which should have beneficial effects on growth over the medium term.</p>

GDP growth, supported by exports and investment, should exceed 4% in 2012. High terms-of-trade continue to favour the mining sector, which has a knock-on effect on the economy. Lower unemployment and higher employment and labour incomes should result in a gradual firming of private consumption. Notwithstanding strong growth, the output gap is estimated to remain through 2012, which will hold down inflationary pressures.</p>

The situation has become more apparent after comprehensive revisions by Eurostat forced parts of the hitherto off-budget deficit and debt items of the railway company and hospitals back onto public balance sheets. The federal government is implementing a consolidation package to reduce the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2013, with savings of about Ä on the revenue side (mainly increases in excise taxes and a bank levy) and Å on the spending side (mainly social expenditure cuts). In this projection, which builds in fiscal consolidation in line with government plans, the deficit falls to 3.7% of GDP by 2011 and 3.2% of GDP by 2012. However, in view of diminishing slack in the economy, a greater front-loading of consolidation would be warranted.</p>

The improving labour market should also support consumption. Employment growth has averaged around 1% per quarter (seasonally adjusted annual rate) since the beginning of 2010, reflecting mostly higher labour demand.

The 2011 budget stipulates fiscal tightening of about ½ per cent of GDP, reflecting a number of small measures. For 2012, these projections build in the Stability Programme’s planned 1% fiscal consolidation, with an even split between revenue raising measures and spending cuts. Against the background of stronger economic growth, this should secure a budget deficit of about 3½ per cent of GDP in 2011 and below 3% the following year. If, as planned, similar consolidation efforts are implemented in the following years, then the medium-term objective of achieving a small budget surplus in 2015 is within reach. Such an achievement would be an important step towards securing fiscal sustainability, but will require a concerted effort by all governments in the federation. Moreover, further consolidation will be needed beyond that to ensure a reduction of the high debt-to-GDP ratio.</p>

At the same time, its objective of reducing the structural budget deficit to 1% of GDP by 2014 is rather modest, even taking reconstruction spending needs into account. Letting the exchange rate float and achieving a more ambitious fiscal target should cool internal demand and avoid inflationary pressures. </emphasis>

          <p id="ID-42-1059947" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Historically high copper prices and increasingly strong domestic demand are supporting swift growth of the Chilean economy, after a partly reconstruction-led rebound following last year’s earthquake and tsunami. Private consumption has been particularly dynamic on the back of favourable consumer confidence, normalised financial conditions and falling unemployment. Investment has expanded strongly as a result of reconstruction efforts and strong mining investment. The current account surplus has declined, as imports grew fast along with domestic demand, but thanks to high copper prices it has remained in positive territory in 2010. The strong growth in output and rapid pace of employment creation has quickly diminished excess capacity contributing to strong nominal wage growth. High international food and oil prices are adding to inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations for one year ahead have risen above the mid-point of the central bank’s inflation tolerance range of 3% (+/- 1%) according to the central bank financial experts’ survey, even though the peso appreciated 23% above its long-term average against the dollar in the second half of 2010.</p>

The government plans to increase spending by 5.4% in real terms in 2011 relative to 2010, to continue reconstruction and expand a number of social programmes. Spending growth is expected to slow in 2012 as reconstruction tapers off. Over the longer term, the government aims to reduce the structural fiscal deficit to 1% of GDP by 2014. This fiscal tightening is modest in a context of strong economic growth and rising inflationary pressures. Reconstruction permitting, Chile should consider tightening the fiscal stance faster to reduce the risk of overheating and ensure fiscal sustainability.</p>

This year, the authorities are pursuing budgetary tightening with an emphasis on expenditure restraint. In particular, cuts in the central-government wage bill are underway. Backed by recently approved medium–term expenditure ceilings, the fiscal deficit is to fall to 3.5% of GDP, and debt is to be held close to 40% of GDP in 2012. With government receipts picking up as a result of renewed growth and additional revenues from a planned VAT increase, these targets are likely to be undershot again. A number of structural reforms are planned for 2012, notably in pensions, healthcare and the tax structure. However, only the tax-structure changes are likely to have a substantial fiscal impact over the projection period.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1060824" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The economic recovery accelerated in the last two quarters to annualised rates of growth above 8%, the highest in the euro area. Growth was led by a surge in net exports and manufacturing driven by strong external demand and competitiveness gains achieved in the adjustment to the severe recession. Investment bottomed out in mid-2010 and then surged in the fourth quarter, reflecting increasing capacity utilisation in manufacturing. In contrast, deleveraging of households, the relatively high burden of non-performing loans and high unemployment continued to weigh on private consumption, which contracted in the fourth quarter. Construction and consumer confidence indicators remain weak.</p>

The unemployment rate continued to fall rapidly from 18.6% in the first quarter of 2010 to 14.5% in the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding employment opportunities in Finland, there is still the risk of an increase in structural unemployment due to the depressed outlook for employment in construction. In this context, it will be important to evaluate and, if needed, improve the effectiveness of active labour market policies.</p>

Exports, which fell sharply during the recession, will remain the main driver of the recovery. Demand from Finland’s main trading partners is vigorous and competitiveness is improving as the real effective exchange rate has weakened and pay settlements result in moderate wage growth. Consumer confidence is high and the household sector balance sheet is in good shape. Hence private consumption should remain healthy, though it is expected to weaken somewhat as inflation erodes real incomes. Business investment is set to rebound as firms rebuild capacity in a climate of high business confidence and strong export order books. Residential investment, however, will be soft as house price rises slow and interest rates rise. Unemployment will continue to decrease as a result of modest employment growth and continuing contraction in the labour force due to ageing. Once the effects of higher oil and commodity prices and indirect tax hikes dissipate, inflation is projected to fall back below 2% due to a still substantial output gap. </p>

The fiscal position has started to improve thanks to the recovery in activity and increases in indirect taxes. Based on the previous government’s tax plans and technical spending assumptions, further progress is expected, bringing the deficit to half a per cent of GDP in 2012. Despite this relatively bright picture, further measures will be needed to preserve fiscal sustainability as ageing increasingly weighs on public finances. Structural reforms to raise labour force participation, improve sustainability of the pension system and enhance public sector efficiency would reinforce medium-term growth prospects and the fiscal outlook.</p>

Based on outcomes so far, which reflect large expenditure cuts, the 2011 central government deficit appears to be in line with targets . Revenue collection, however, continues to fall below expectations despite a marked improvement in VAT receipts. The OECD projection is for a deficit of 7½ per cent of GDP in 2011 and 6½ per cent of GDP by 2012 – similar to the official targets under the EU/IMF economic programme. The projections take into account the additional measures announced in April 2011 by the government to offset the fiscal slippage in 2010. Public debt is projected to rise to over 150% of GDP by end-2012, even accounting for expected privatisation receipts. Such a high debt level underscores the imperative nature of continued fiscal consolidation and the need for further structural fiscal reforms. Comprehensive structural reforms to dynamise labour and product markets are also indispensible to raise employment and incomes, and to improve debt dynamics.</p>

By the end of the first quarter, the cumulated cash budget deficit (excluding local governments) already exceeded the full-year official target of 2.4% of GDP, although temporary taxes levied on specific sectors should mitigate the extent of the deficit. Furthermore, the dismantling of the second pillar of the pension system will provide sizeable one-off revenues of around 9% of GDP and shift the general government balance to surplus on an accruals basis in 2011. However, since part of the second-pillar pension assets will be used to finance current expenditure while pension liabilities have been transferred to the government, long-term fiscal sustainability has deteriorated. The assumption of the debt of public transport companies by the government and the buyout of public-private projects will, also on a one-off basis, lower the surplus this year. </p>

More recently, the authorities have undertaken welcome steps to shore up the fiscal position. A stability fund financed by restraints on current expenditure should reduce the risk of breaching the cash deficit target for 2011. In addition, a programme of structural reforms with expected savings of 2.9% of GDP in 2012 and 2013 has been released, although detailed policy measures and draft legislation have yet to be elaborated. A credible implementation of both steps is critical for improving fiscal sustainability.</p>

Residential investment also rose as an improving real estate outlook spurred work on incomplete projects. However, business investment continued to decline, albeit more slowly, owing to the ending of large energy-intensive projects, corporate deleveraging and high levels of spare capacity. Employment continued to fall in the year to the first quarter of 2011, increasing the unemployment rate to 7.5% (seasonally adjusted). Compared with a year earlier, real wage increases in the private sector picked up to 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010, eroding earlier falls. The annual inflation rate rose to 2.8% in the year to April owing to a decline in the exchange rate and a rise in commodity prices. The underlying current account balance (which excludes net income payments of credit institutions in winding-up proceedings) remains in small surplus.</p>

This projection assumes that discretionary measures of 3.5% of GDP in 2011 and 2% in 2012 are fully implemented. With public interest payments rising fast, this would result in the fiscal deficit declining from 12.1% of GDP in 2010 (excluding bank support measures) to 10.1% in 2011 and 8.2% in 2012.

          </heading>
          <p id="ID-42-1062565" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The March 2011 bank stress tests were perceived as credible by financial markets as evidenced by a fall in the spread of Irish over German sovereign bond yields. It is important for the return to growth that the recapitalisation and associated restructuring of the banking system occurs without delay. In line with government and EU-IMF programme partner projections, it is assumed that the government will provide, EUR 19 billion (13% of GDP) of the EUR 24 billion in capital needs identified by the stress tests and that the government will receive equivalent assets in return (thus leaving the headline fiscal deficit unchanged). It is possible that some of this transaction will eventually be classified by Eurostat as a capital transfer. If so, these amounts would be added to the headline deficit, but they would have no implications for the consolidation plan to 2015. Either way, combined with the ongoing borrowing needs of the government, this would result in gross public debt measured on a Maastricht basis increasing from 96% of GDP in 2010 to 119% of GDP in 2012. It is assumed that the government will finance the full fiscal deficit and repayment of maturing debt in 2011 and 2012 using funds disbursed under the EU/IMF programme. These funds are sufficient to cover financing needs in both years. On this basis, net government interest payments are projected to increase from 2.4% of GDP in 2010 to 3.9% of GDP in 2012.</p>

The yield differential on long-term bonds<emphasis emph="italic"> vis-à-vis </emphasis>Germany is assumed to remain constant at its level in April throughout 2011 and then to halve in the course of 2012 as progress in consolidation and economic adjustment leads to a spontaneous increase in confidence or perceptions increase that additional official financing would be forthcoming, if needed. Risks to this projection are balanced. Private consumption may be hit harder than projected by declining household incomes and the weak labour market. In addition, although there have been important forward steps, the banking system has yet to be returned to health, constraining its capability to deliver credit for investment. On the upside, ongoing gains in cost-competiveness may see faster export growth with Ireland gaining market share.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1062841" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The authorities are continuing a complex strategy of quelling domestic price pressures through policy-rate increases and specific steps to damp house-price inflation, while also implementing measures to shield the export sector from currency appreciation. Since January the policy rate has been hiked by 100 basis points to 3%. This marks a welcome acceleration in policy normalisation. At the same time, efforts to restrain shekel appreciation continue. The Bank of Israel still makes discretionary purchases of foreign currency, and in January it imposed a 10% reserve requirement on banks’ foreign-exchange derivative contracts with non-residents. Furthermore, a bill removing non-residents’ exemption from a 15% withholding tax on income from short-term bonds has been passed by the Knesset. These efforts to protect the tradeables sector by restraining the exchange rate are increasingly at odds with the pace of economic recovery. Non-diamond goods exports in the second half of 2010 were rather weak; however, monthly data on the dollar value of exports thus far in 2011 indicate a return to rapid growth. If export growth looks set to be strong, then the authorities should return to straightforward single-instrument monetary policy.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1062861" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Strong revenue growth in 2010 combined with adherence to a spending ceiling rule brought a reduction in the general-government deficit from 6.4% of GDP in 2009 to 5.0% in 2010, according to a standardised OECD definition. The broad fiscal strategy for 2011-12 (Israel has adopted a two-year budget system) continues to give priority to income-tax cuts and deficit reduction through a tight lid on spending increases and selective increases in indirect taxation. In early 2011 there was some softening of this strategy. An increase in excise on vehicle fuel was reversed and commitments have been made to reduce increases in water prices, cut public-transport fares and bring forward minimum–wage increases. To offset the fiscal impact of these moves, scheduled cuts in some income-tax rates may be postponed.</p>

To stem inflationary pressure the policy rate should be boosted to 4.75% by year-end and a further 75 basis points in 2012. These increases may be smaller if the shekel appreciates further, which in turn partly depends on whether currency intervention continues. The fiscal projection embodies deficit reductions of 1.3 percentage points of GDP in 2011 and 0.8 points in 2012, broadly reflecting government targets.</p>

The household sector, which had debt amounting to 124% of household income in 2010, will be negatively impacted by higher borrowing costs, as well as the terms-of-trade loss from increased oil and commodity prices, limiting the growth of private consumption. The 11 March disaster in Japan, which supplies about a quarter of Korea’s imports of parts and capital equipment, is currently expected to reduce exports only temporarily. A return to double-digit gains in exports, which account for one-half of GDP, will be an important source of growth through 2012. Business and consumer confidence remains high, despite some decline in recent months. Slowing output growth should help bring headline inflation back into the central bank’s target zone from the second half of 2011, while the unemployment rate stabilises at around 3½ per cent. The current account surplus in projected to recede from 2.8% of GDP in 2010 to less than 2% in 2011-12, reflecting the impact of higher oil prices.</p>

Private consumption and investment will gain momentum from improved confidence, low interest rates and better labour market conditions. Exports are likely to remain strong as financial and business services play a major role in driving the expansion, while demand for goods increases with stronger demand and investment activity elsewhere. Fiscal consolidation should modestly damp demand. Employment will continue to grow at a robust pace but the unemployment rate will fall only gradually, held back by structural policies that constrain labour demand and reduce the effective labour supply of resident workers.</p>

The budget for 2011 aims to bring the deficit to 1% of GDP. In addition to the cyclical recovery, the plan includes restraint on expenditures, notably public investment, as well as tax increases, including a hike in the top income tax rate. Some further measures may be needed to meet the objective of balancing the budget by 2014. More ambitious consolidation and major reforms to the pension system are needed to be meet the challenge from large future pension costs,. Implementation of a comprehensive and far-reaching pension reform is needed to achieve sustainability.</p>

The projection assumes that the government will implement its plans to return to a balanced budget, based on the national definition of the deficit, by 2012. Oil production has stabilised for now, but the government should reduce its dependence on this volatile source of revenue by implementing further tax reform and withdrawing energy subsidies more quickly. Meanwhile, the central bank can wait to raise interest rates, as slack in production capacity remains large, core inflation has fallen throughout 2010 and inflation expectations remain well anchored. Thus recent food price increases are not expected to lead to important second round effects.</emphasis>

Thus, activity is increasingly supported by domestic demand, while trade growth has normalised. The trade and current account deficits remain moderate. Employment is now well above pre-crisis levels, although with Mexicans returning to the labour force employment growth has not been strong enough to bring down unemployment significantly.</p>

The projection assumes that the government will implement some further expenditure restraint in 2011 and 2012, as foreseen in the budget. The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to fall from 5½ per cent in 2009 to 2½ per cent in 2012. This would translate into a closing of the combined deficit of the central government and its public enterprises, on the national definition. This excludes PEMEX’s investment spending, but – unlike in the standard national accounts definition – includes a number of pure financing operations. This deficit reduction is needed to maintain the sustainability of Mexico’s public finances. In the longer term, the government should aim for more independence from oil-related tax revenues, for example through broadening the tax base and removing energy subsidies faster than currently planned. Any extra revenues from higher than expected oil prices should be saved in the oil stabilisation fund.</p>

Supportive financial conditions have thus contributed to the recovery of domestic demand, as have stronger employment growth and increasing remittances sent by Mexican workers abroad. Mexico can afford to keep policy rates low for some time in view of declining inflation, still considerable unused capacities and moderate wage increases. Medium-term inflation expectations are reasonably well-anchored according to the central bank’s survey, with experts expecting inflation to remain within the upper half of the central bank’s target range.</p>

However, strong internal demand will not fully compensate for the normalisation of export growth, which is tapering off after an exceptionally strong rebound.

Employment is expected to continue its recovery, driving unemployment down to pre-crisis levels in 2012. The current account balance is projected to widen mildly, as imports strengthen along with domestic demand. The recent uptick in headline inflation owing to food price increases is not expected to lead to second-round effects given the still large unused production capacity and continuing slack in labour markets. Both headline and core inflation are expected to remain within the target range in 2012.</p>

Private consumption is likely to remain in check due to the slow wage growth and the effects of contractionary policies. Employment should continue to rise, leading a gradual fall in the unemployment rate to below 4% by the end of 2012, but a rapid pick-up in wages is not expected. As a consequence, inflation (both headline and core) should stabilise at below 2%. A spike in headline inflation is expected mid-2011 due to the periodic adjustment of Dutch energy contracts.</p>

Households bore around two-thirds of the property losses, nearly all being covered by a mix of public and private insurance. The government’s Earthquake Commission will fund the public insurance payouts (at some 3½ per cent of GDP) by means of both own asset drawdowns and international reinsurance.</p>

However, underlying inflation remains subdued, given the weakness of demand. In March, the Reserve Bank reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points to 2.5% as <shortcitation>insurance</shortcitation> to limit the risk of a widespread fall in confidence following the earthquake. It also noted that the earthquake rebuild in a context of reduced capacity would put pressure on resources. With core inflation expected to remain above the 2% mid-point of the target band throughout the projection horizon, interest rates will need to start to rise around year-end and return to neutral levels by end-2012.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1064333" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The earthquakes’ medium-term fiscal costs are estimated at 6% of GDP, over two-thirds of which represents higher spending and the remainder lost tax revenues due to weaker economic activity. The major spending items are the public earthquake insurance payments to households and repair of local infrastructure, each estimated at 1.5% of GDP. Exceptional public expenses will also arise for health care, disability, employment income losses, temporary lodging and other assistance programmes. The general government deficit is projected to reach 8½ per cent of GDP in 2011, when many of these costs are incurred. Despite this, the government has signalled that it plans to meet its medium-term consolidation objectives by imposing a freeze on overall nominal discretionary spending in the May budget; that is, spending increases in some areas will be offset by reductions elsewhere. The projections assume spending restraint apart from earthquake expenses.</p>

Rebuilding is projected to get more fully underway in 2012 and continue to add to demand for several years. Record-high commodity prices will also provide support. Private investment and consumption should start to recover more surely, though needed fiscal consolidation will start to bite and private debt reduction will probably be sustained.</p>

On the domestic side, consumer confidence and investment expectations have returned to their very high pre-crisis levels. Credit demand and housing investment have been rising, with house prices reaching record levels. On the external side, rising oil prices have boosted public revenues and petroleum-sector investment. Recent figures on unemployment indicate the beginning of a recovery in the labour market. Despite the strength of the economy, wage increases were moderate in 2010. This and the appreciation of the krone relative to the currencies of Norway’s major trading partners have contributed to consumer price inflation remaining low so far.</p>

The mainland economy is estimated to expand by 3.3% in 2011 and 4% in 2012. Higher domestic demand will exert favourable effects on the labour market, and will slowly push up wage growth.

Strong growth in the GPFG, the repository of net petroleum revenues, should bring the structural non-oil budget deficit down to or below 4% of assets in the GPFG in 2011. The continuing increase in world trade will lead to a modest rise in non-petroleum export growth over the projection period. Nonetheless, owing to high consumer confidence as well as the continued strength of the krone, imports are expected to outpace exports, leading to a moderate reduction of the current account surplus.</p>

Household consumption was nonetheless cushioned by booming purchases of durable goods, in anticipation of the 2011 increase in VAT. With this effect being reversed, consumption has weakened significantly, resulting in a further contraction of output in early 2011. Against this background, the recent acceleration in core inflation has largely reflected increases in the VAT and in regulated prices, and the rise in global oil prices has further fuelled headline inflation. Labour market conditions have remained depressed. Despite strong export growth, the current account deficit narrowed only marginally in 2010, as imports were boosted by the temporary consumption boom and sizeable military equipment purchases.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1065283" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">After two months of mounting pressure from financial markets, with yields and spreads soaring, the current caretaker government decided in April to request external financial assistance from the European Union and the IMF. Tensions were exacerbated by the government’s resignation (announced in late March) in the wake of the parliamentary rejection of a new austerity package. The political crisis triggered a wave of credit rating downgrades for the state and enterprises. Banks continue to have virtually no access to wholesale debt markets and are therefore heavily dependent on ECB financing, amounting to e48 billion in April 2011. Credit growth has slowed, and consumer credit outstanding has even fallen slightly. This trend will likely be aggravated as banks shrink their balance sheets.</p>

Several one-offs and exceptional events – mainly receipts from a pension fund, outlays due to banking losses, major military equipment purchases and the reclassification of three public-private partnership projects as part of public investment – partly cancelled each other out, with an overall negative impact on the deficit of around 0.6% of GDP. For 2011, the OECD projections incorporate the consolidation measures legislated in the 2011 Budget, as well as additional restraint in a number of areas, such as subsidies and public investment, as claimed by the authorities. For 2012, the measures envisaged under the EU/IMF financial assistance programme are taken on board. The 10-year government bond yield differential<emphasis emph="italic"> vis-à-vis </emphasis>Germany is projected to remain at its average level in April (5.8 percentage points) for the remainder of 2011 and then to halve in 2012 as progress in consolidation and economic adjustment leads to a spontaneous increase in confidence or perceptions increase that additional official financing would be forthcoming, if needed. Further, it is assumed that only a minor part of the government financing needs in 2011 and 2012 will be funded in the markets. Strictly implementing the fiscal and structural policy reforms foreseen in the financial assistance programme is essential both to ensure fiscal sustainability and to enhance the growth potential of the economy.</p>

The unemployment rate is expected to rise further. With subdued demand and growing spare capacity, inflation should decrease markedly once the impact of rising oil prices and indirect taxation vanishes. The current account is projected to improve significantly, though the gain from trade volumes is partly undone by trade prices (especially in 2011, largely due to more expensive oil) and a worsening income balance.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1065582" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The main feature of the projection is the weakness in private consumption in 2011, which reflects fiscal consolidation measures and a slow recovery of employment. The government plans ambitious cuts in the budget deficit in 2011 and 2012 to reach its target of 2.9% of GDP in 2013. In 2011, the consolidation package should amount to around 2.5% of GDP, 60% coming from public expenditure cuts, which will weaken domestic demand. In particular, the planned 10% cut in public wage costs, to be achieved both through layoffs and cuts in remuneration, already has had a negative impact on the labour market. Unemployment rose somewhat further at the beginning of the year, suggesting that layoffs in the public sector exceeded employment gains in the private sector. Together with the increase in hours worked per employee, this will damp the overall employment response during the recovery. As a result, unemployment is expected to decline only slowly in 2011 overall and is likely to induce a certain level of wage moderation and a stagnation in real household disposal income. </p>

Growth will continue to be mainly driven by exports, as foreign demand is expected to remain strong. In addition, low increases in worker compensation will maintain cost competitiveness of exporting firms. While the partial cancellation of public-private-partnership projects for motorway construction may lower public investment expenditure, announced private investments, in particular in the automotive sector, should boost gross capital formation. Favourable monetary conditions will also sustain investment growth. In 2012, growth is expected to bounce back and reach 4.4% as less fiscal tightening is budgeted and a more progressive employment recovery will trigger a rebound in domestic consumption. While headline inflation will be pushed up in the short run by increases in commodity prices, underlying inflationary pressures are expected to be limited as the output gap remains negative.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1065868" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The government has embarked on fiscal consolidation to reduce the budget deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2013, primarily through containing the public-sector wage bill and transfers, and cutting capital spending. The plan to reduce public employment by 1% a year through 2013 should be strictly implemented, notwithstanding slippage in 2010. However, a number of factors may jeopardise the fiscal consolidation. The 2010 pension reform will be voted on in a referendum set for 5 June 2011 amid a politically challenging environment. If it is rejected, long-term fiscal sustainability will be undermined and the macroeconomic outlook could deteriorate considerably, given current volatility in international financial markets. The recapitalisation of systemic banks is already underway and will contribute significantly to the 2011 budget deficit. Further capital injections could exert additional pressure on public finances. While banks have to adapt to new regulatory requirements, credit flows to the business sector have been reduced. To encourage credit activity, the authorities plan to introduce a tax applying to banks with a relatively low exposure to the business sector. However, such a measure interferes with the risk management of banks, which is a particular concern at a time when banks need to repair their balance sheets and the corporate sector is overleveraged.</p>

Industrial production strengthened and strong tourism receipts have raised services revenues. External demand has boosted business equipment investment. Household consumption growth slowed as real disposable incomes were hit by rising oil prices, which pushed consumer price inflation to 3.5% in April. Employment losses continued while the unemployment rate steadied at above 20%. House prices have fallen by around 20% from their peak in real terms and continued to fall in the first quarter of 2011, in part owing to the withdrawal of tax subsidies for owner-occupiers at the end of 2010. While the downsizing of residential construction is well-advanced, activity is set to remain depressed for some time, given the overhang of unsold dwellings.</p>

Regional and local governments also raised personal income and real estate tax rates. Spending cuts are projected to amount to about 2½ per cent of GDP in 2011. Spending restraint measures include continued cutbacks in public investment, as well as in public sector pay and employment at all levels of government and the removal of child benefits. Most pension payments are frozen in nominal terms. In 2012 cuts in public sector employment will continue and the central government has announced further reductions of consumption and transfer spending, although these have yet to be specified. Finally, the government has announced it will lower public investment spending, which remains high in international comparison, by as much as necessary to reach its target. The projections assume that the deficit target of 4.4% of GDP will be reached.</p>

The authorities have taken several measures to reduce investors’ risk perceptions. Banks have been required to publish detailed information on real estate exposures. Capital requirements have been raised. Savings banks, which have undergone restructuring but face substantial exposure to the housing developers, will need injections worth 1.4% of GDP, partly from the government, to meet these new requirements. Exposure of Spanish financial intermediaries to Portuguese debtors is concentrated on the non-financial private sector, which is less affected by the debt crisis. A reform of the public pension system expected to be approved by parliament will damp the expected long-term increase in pension spending and improve work incentives. Higher short-term interest rates will raise households’ debt servicing costs with a lag of about one year.</p>

Headline inflation (which includes mortgage interest rate costs) is expected to be around the official target of 2%, which is a bit higher than core inflation reflecting increases in interest rates. However, with some signs that inflation expectations may be rising and with wage pressures likely to pick up if labour force participation increases less than expected, the central bank needs to remain vigilant. Indeed, it intends to continue the hikes in the policy interest rate which began in July 2010. The fiscal stance is set to tighten, starting in 2012. The economic expansion and the government’s fiscal framework will help move the budget back into surplus from 2011.</p>

This, together with a moderation in import growth as domestic demand eases, will help to stabilise the current account surplus and lead to a slight pick-up in GDP growth.

          <p id="ID-42-1066800" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Growth reached 8.9% in 2010, far exceeding most projections, including those that underpinned last year’s budget. Private investment and consumption were the key drivers. Government demand remained subdued and exports proved weak. With private domestic demand driving the recovery, and against the backdrop of significant real exchange rate appreciation, imports accelerated. Strong business and consumer confidence, as well as rising industrial production and capital good imports, point to continued buoyancy in 2011.</p>

          </heading>
          <p id="ID-42-1066957" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">CPI inflation fell from 9.6% in the first quarter of 2010 to just under 4% in March 2011 – a historical low which resulted from favourable base effects and service price moderation. Headline inflation is heavily affected by volatile food prices, which have been subdued recently but are expected to increase. Higher food prices, together with higher prices for other commodities, are expected to put upward pressure on inflation in the rest of the year. Core inflation fell through most of 2010 but has moved back up since November. Producer prices are running ahead of consumer prices. However, economic slack persists, with capacity utilisation at below pre-crisis levels (due to very strong investment growth) and decreasing but still high unemployment. Thus, underlying inflation pressures have remained relatively muted to date. Inflation expectations for the end of 2011 remain within the target band of the Central Bank of 5.5±2%, although above its mid-point.</p>

Despite recent competitiveness gains, imports grew strongly in the early months of 2011, far outpacing exports. Oil price increases contributed to the deterioration (every $10 increase in oil prices raises the external deficit by 0.5% of GDP). Tensions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region – which absorbs 25% of total Turkish exports of goods – damped manufacturing exports, although they also improved prospects for tourism in Turkey. The external deficit continues to be easily financed, but mostly by reversible short-term capital inflows. Capital inflows of undetermined origin – possibly related to unrest in neighbouring countries – have recently accelerated.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1066997" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Since December 2010, a new monetary policy has been implemented, combining low policy interest rates (to stem capital inflows) with sizeable increases in banks’ required reserves (to slow credit growth). So far, this policy mix has helped to restrain currency appreciation. Credit growth has slowed in certain areas, but exhibits considerable inertia overall. In April 2011, total credit outstanding was still 35% above its level a year ago. Policymakers assert that the targeted credit containment will be secured, if necessary with additional regulatory measures. It is indeed essential that domestic demand starts to slow down already from the second quarter of 2011. OECD projections are predicated on the achievement of this goal. Credit conditions are then expected to normalise in 2012, and policy interest rates are projected to rise.</p>

          <p id="ID-42-1067017" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Fiscal policy was kept tight through 2010. The bulk of central government windfall revenues from stronger-than-expected growth in 2010 appears to have been saved. No significant fiscal drift has been observed in the run-up to legislative elections in June 2011, although there are signs that agricultural transfers and public investment have significantly accelerated. Indeed, total primary government spending has recently been rising much less than GDP and tax revenues. OECD projections assume that this fiscal stance will be maintained through the projection period, although additional tightening may become necessary through the year. After the postponement of the previously planned fiscal rule, a simpler explicit public expenditure ceiling at the general government level would help anchor fiscal policy.</p>

As Turkey’s very high energy dependence cannot be reduced in the short term, it is crucial to strengthen external competitiveness and rebalance the sources of growth. Structural reforms would help reduce the cost of doing business in the formal sector. A regional differentiation of minimum wages, taking into account differences in productivity levels and living costs, would support not only price competitiveness, but also non-price competitiveness by facilitating the development of formal firms, which have higher productivity than informal ones for a number of reasons.</p>

Growth is then projected to pick up strongly in the course of 2012 after the normalisation of credit conditions, with annual growth of about 5½ per cent for the year as a whole. If capital markets were to become uncomfortable with the high and rising current account deficit, some abrupt exchange rate adjustment might ensue, creating financial strains. Any new civic tensions in the MENA region may also depress external demand. On the other hand, if policy-driven restraints prove less effective than intended, growth may be too strong and put excessive pressure on resources. Stronger growth in Europe would lift exports and growth.</p>

Domestic demand has been the main engine of growth, outstripping supply and resulting in markedly increased imports.

Past successive increases in the <emphasis emph="italic">Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras</emphasis> (IOF) tax on foreign-income investment did not restrain capital inflows on a sustained basis. The tax may have shifted them towards securities with longer maturities, but it remains to be seen whether this compositional effect will persist. Since March, the authorities have closed a number of loopholes and changed rules on taxes paid on foreign loans several times. They increased the tax applied on repatriated funds and applied the IOF tax rate to renewed, renegotiated or transferred loans.</p>

Rising inflation expectations threaten to pass through into costs, adding to price pressures. The positive output gap has also exerted pressure but to a much lesser extent. Inflationary tensions are expected to persist, even as commodity prices stabilise, as the effects of the currency appreciation dissipate and demand remains strong. The unemployment rate has fallen to a record-low level, and labour markets are tight.</p>

It tightened reserve and capital requirements in December, increased the tax on consumer credit and lifted its policy rate by a total of 125 basis points, to 12%, since the beginning of the year. Acknowledging that the costs of bringing inflation down to 4.5% in 2011 may be too high, the Central Bank has shifted its focus and aims to guarantee inflation convergence to the target by 2012. It has also signalled it would adopt a gradualist approach and rely heavily on macro-prudential measures. In the current environment, this strategy is not without danger. Core inflation might rise further, and entrenched expectations of higher inflation would be detrimental to the Bank’s long-term credibility and make subsequent disinflation more costly. While macro-prudential measures may help to restrain credit growth, they should be considered only as a complement to conventional monetary tightening.</p>

          <p id="ID-C03-42-1056000" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Fiscal policy was strongly expansionary during the recovery, fuelling an unsustainable path of rising domestic demand and contributing to a rapid deterioration of the current account. The authorities have announced a BRL 50 billion spending cut in the 2011 federal budget, corresponding to about 0.5 percentage point of GDP compared with 2010 (after correcting from the capitalisation of the state-owned oil enterprise <emphasis emph="italic">Petrobras </emphasis>which artificially boosted spending in September 2010). To achieve this goal, the government plans to target discretionary spending while safeguarding social and infrastructure programmes. Early signs are promising, as public revenues expanded at a much faster pace than spending in the first quarter of the year. Following some moderation this year, the minimum wage is set to rise by 13% in 2012, with ripple effects on the growth of social security benefits, which are linked to it. Nevertheless, the primary balance target is expected to be reached both in 2011 and 2012, but only with the use of contingency measures, such as the exclusion of some infrastructure spending. The announced spending cuts are a welcome first step toward fiscal consolidation. However, the government needs to persevere with efforts in this direction, to ease both inflationary pressures and capital inflows. The credibility of the fiscal consolidation would be enhanced by committing to a multi-year budgetary programme, which would reassure markets that measures will not be reversed in the coming years.</p>

As excess demand in the economy is gradually eliminated and import prices stop rising, inflation should ease back in 2012.

          <p id="ID-C03-42-1056250" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Inflation has continued to rise. Annual CPI inflation exceeded 5% in recent months, with double-digit increases in food and gasoline prices. The rise in global crude oil prices has been fully passed on to consumers. However, private consumption represents only slightly more than a quarter of total demand. Prices for consumption, investment and exports combined rose faster than the CPI, and were up by 6.7% in the year to the first quarter. Cost inflation is also on the rise. In the past two years, the minimum wage rate in the southern city of Shenzhen was raised by 32%, though this partly reflected catch-up from a standstill in 2009. Similarly large hikes occurred elsewhere in the country. In addition, by the first quarter of 2011, import prices were up 16% on a year earlier. Against this, prices of electricity are controlled, resulting in local shortages.</p>

It had fallen to 2.5% of GDP by the first quarter of 2011, although it rebounded in April, in part because imports from Japan dropped by 5% due to supply-chain problems. The oil import bill is estimated to have risen by almost 1½ percentage points of GDP in the year to the second quarter of 2011, given the rise in world prices. Other commodity prices have also increased substantially. China’s share of world trade ceased to expand over the past year due to higher labour costs and export prices. The continued rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which by March 2011 exceeded $3 trillion, has pushed up investment income, helping generate a current account surplus of around 4.6% of GDP in the first quarter of 2011.</p>

          <p id="ID-C03-42-1056426" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Monetary policy has been tightened gradually since October 2010. Official interest rates have been raised, in steps, by a cumulative 114 basis points for three-month deposits. The required reserve ratio has been lifted by 3½ percentage points in total, reaching 21% in May for large banks. Tighter liquidity has pushed the interbank rate well above regulated saving deposit rates. In addition, the central bank introduced lending quotas for each bank. These measures have successfully restrained the growth of both money and credit to just under 16% over the 12 months to April, which is in line with the central bank’s monetary targets for 2011. However, the depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate during this period has tended to offset the impact of higher interest rates and required reserves. Given continued high inflation, a further increase of 50 basis points in regulated interest rates may be needed to stabilise inflation.</p>

The fiscal deficit was reduced in 2010 and the government plans on a further reduction in 2011 of 0.5% of GDP. Tax revenues have been rising rapidly. This has given the government room to raise the threshold for income taxation substantially, so that, once again, no person earning less than the average wage will pay income tax and the bulk of taxpayers will face a marginal rate of 10%. Taking into account the continuing social security surplus, the general government may run a 	slight deficit in 2011 and a surplus in 2012. Local authority off-budget borrowing is being restrained this year and must be used to finance social housing.</p>

          </heading>
          <p id="ID-C03-42-1056467" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Tighter monetary policy will restrain growth in 2011. Investment growth is likely to remain weaker than in 2010, as lending is restricted. Further planned increases in minimum wages will push up average wages and unit labour costs, and fuel inflationary pressures. In addition, the higher cost of crude oil will push up consumer prices directly and, as importantly, raise the price of all transported goods with a lag. As a result, CPI inflation is projected to exceed the government’s target of 4% for 2011 as a whole. In 2012, more subdued import price increases should clip 1½ percentage points from the inflation rate, boosting real incomes. There should be no further need for monetary tightening in 2012 and growth is projected to edge back up again. The government’s target to raise wages by 15% annually for the next five years may result in a slight increase in the growth of unit labour costs, to around 5% per year. Higher domestic costs will erode competitiveness and, along with deteriorating terms of trade, will contribute to holding down the current account surplus to around 4½ per cent of GDP. Structural reforms, such as increasing competition in state-dominated sectors and services, would boost productivity and real incomes, strengthening domestic demand.</p>

This would reverse progress in lessening state control of the economy and risk undermining longer-term growth. The increasing movement of activity to the inland regions of the country could boost output and real incomes there more than expected, as new capacity is added to take advantage of lower labour costs. In coastal areas, manufacturers may be able to adapt more rapidly than foreseen to higher labour costs, thus enabling them to achieve greater gains in market shares than projected.</p>

Much of the slowing reflected an unwinding of a strong post-crisis bounce in investment. Activity in the non-agricultural sector eased somewhat towards the end of the year and recent industrial production figures indicate this slowing has continued into 2011. In contrast, agricultural production has continued to expand at a brisk pace, consolidating its recovery from an earlier drought. Trade also rebounded strongly in 2010, with both import and export volumes rising above pre-crisis highs. The current account deficit has been large by Indian standards, but it narrowed in the fourth quarter, as imports moderated. Inflows of portfolio capital have also slowed to a more normal pace, following a strong rise earlier in the year. At the same time, equity prices have eased.</p>

Moreover, inflation has become generalised. Higher oil prices have led to sharp increases in fuel and energy prices. A re-emergence of food inflation reflects in part localised supply constraints, but also rising incomes. Wholesale prices for manufactured goods have also accelerated, likely reflecting the emergence of capacity constraints in the wake of very rapid growth. In order to reduce food inflation pressures the government has announced several initiatives aimed at improving the food supply chain, including the upgrading of food storage facilities. These efforts could be complemented by further liberalising restrictions on foreign direct investment in the retail sector.</p>

          </heading>
          <p id="ID-C03-42-1056833" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Incoming budget data confirm that fiscal consolidation commenced in FY 2010, with the central government deficit estimated to have declined by over 1% of GDP, to around 5%. Consolidation has also resumed at the state level, ensuring an even larger improvement in general government finances. The reduction in the central government deficit was, however, significantly aided by one-off revenue windfalls, notably from the auction of 3G and broadband wireless licences. The central government budget plans for a further reduction in the deficit in FY 2011, underpinned by strong revenue growth and a sharp slowing in spending. In addition it commits to improve the delivery of some subsidies through direct cash transfers in 2012. However, in the meantime, the government raised subsidies on fertilisers. With crude oil prices remaining at a high level, the government is projected to split the costs of higher prices for oil-related products equally between consumers, oil companies and itself, leading to higher public spending. Altogether this additional spending is expected to amount to just over ½ per cent of GDP in FY 2011. Further pressure for higher spending could come from wage hikes under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and increased outlays on an expanded food subsidy programme. Eventually, the government may also have to recapitalise public-sector oil marketing companies.</p>

Since the exit from emergency policy settings in early 2010 the main repo rate had been raised by a total of 250 basis points, to 7.25% by May 2011. However, credit-market pressures, reflecting temporary imbalances between deposits and the demand for loans, have led to considerably larger increases in commercial borrowing costs. In the first quarter of 2011 the 3-month interbank rate averaged around 9½ per cent, around 170 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter of 2010. The renewed acceleration in prices and the generalisation of inflationary pressures increase the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. It is therefore important that the Reserve Bank continues to tighten incrementally.</p>

Going forward, portfolio and foreign direct investment inflows underpinned by relatively high interest rates and a strong medium-term outlook for growth, will help ensure continued smooth financing.

Headline inflation has been lower than expected in early 2011 due to easing food prices, but the year-on-year rate is still over 6% and core inflation is accelerating. Business surveys point to further inflationary pressures in the near future, thanks to favourable economic prospects and significant capital inflows. Bank Indonesia (BI) raised the policy rate once by 25 basis points in February, following cumulative cuts of 300 basis points during the downturn. Besides rate increases, BI announced that it will rely on exchange-rate appreciation and macroprudential measures in order to control inflation without making Indonesia still more attractive as a destination for capital inflows. Though welcome instruments, they will not be able to replace urgently needed interest rate increases. Unless rates are raised immediately the end-2011 inflation target is at considerable risk. Further upgrades in credit ratings, which are now one notch below investment grade, will likely depend on successfully reining in inflation.</p>

Despite some reform efforts, government agencies continue to underspend and to skew spending towards the end of the year. Indeed, spending has again started very slowly in 2011 after having increased strongly in late 2010. To reduce underspending, especially on infrastructure investment and health insurance coverage, disbursement procedures should be simplified even further. Government revenues will increase due to strong growth, higher oil and gas revenues and export taxes. In the light of rising oil prices, the government has postponed the schedule for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. This will make it more challenging to meet its earlier commitment of eliminating them by 2014, but will leave households with more disposable income in the short term. However, as energy subsidies are not an efficient way to combat poverty, and distort expenditure in undesirable ways, the original phase-out schedule should be maintained.</p>

The pace of expansion is likely to ease somewhat in 2012 as the effects of interest rate hikes feed through. Strong investment increases are underpinned by solid credit growth, buoyant FDI inflows and new tax incentives for house purchases. Following free trade agreements in 2010, China and India are becoming increasingly important markets for Indonesia. Commodity exports, for which external demand conditions are positive, are likely to be robust, but manufacturing exports will also grow quickly. Reflecting strong domestic demand and rupiah appreciation, imports are expected to grow more rapidly than exports, almost eliminating the current account surplus. Unemployment should keep declining. Inflation is expected to gradually slow, but would at best remain in the upper half of the target range.</p>

Gross capital formation in 2010 advanced particularly strongly, mostly on account of inventories. Notwithstanding very strong imports, the current account surplus widened as the terms of trade improved. The preliminary GDP estimate for the first quarter of 2011 indicates a slowdown to 2½ per cent annualised. Pronounced weakness in fixed investment appears to have undercut demand growth in the first quarter, although most high-frequency indicators pointed to continued strong expansion.</p>

The upsurge was largely driven by food price increases resulting from the heat and drought during last summer. The crop losses and the panic which set in pushed the price of cereals up by 85% in the year to April 2011, an increase that was then passed on to a number of other food items, such as meat and sunflower oil. Monetary factors also played a role, as a significant amount of liquidity was injected into the economy via only partially sterilised foreign exchange interventions and the running down of government deposits at the central bank to finance the budget deficit. Although underlying inflation pressures appear to be contained, given the negative output gap and broadly unchanged core inflation, the government has resorted to a number of interventions to bring the headline rate down, such as curtailing petrol exports, selling grain from reserves and holding down tariff increases for natural monopolies.</p>

Rising oil prices have boosted revenues and have improved the fiscal position faster than envisaged by the government, however. Based on current oil prices and spending plans, the headline budget deficit should be eliminated this year; the budget was already in surplus in the first four months of the year. Before the surge in oil prices, the government intended to divest its stakes in a number of large companies and banks. These privatisation plans should be pursued, even in the absence of financing needs, as this is one of the measures needed to reduce state control over economic activity.</p>

It has at times intervened in the foreign exchange markets to mitigate rouble appreciation in the wake of strong current account inflows linked to rising oil prices. At the same time, it has also been allowing more exchange rate fluctuation than in the past and is trying to use its constellation of policy rates and reserve requirements to smooth market interest rates and bring inflation down to low and stable levels. This more flexible exchange rate policy has, however, not yet been tested by large-scale foreign currency inflows through the financial account as, contrary to the pre-crisis period, rising oil prices have not been accompanied by increasing net capital inflows. Instead, Russian corporations and banks have so far chosen to improve their net foreign asset positions.</p>

Bank lending has already been boosted by abundant liquidity and the improved creditworthiness of large resource-based companies. Given a high income elasticity of imports, faster growth in absorption should translate into import volume growth which will significantly outpace growth in export volumes this year and next. The current account surplus will nonetheless widen this year to about 7% of GDP due to higher oil prices before narrowing slightly next year. Output growth is projected to approach 5% in 2011, before moderating to 4.5% in 2012. Annual average inflation will exceed 9% in 2011, but then fall to 6.4% in 2012 as the impact of the food price shock fades away.</p>

In the context of the 2011 parliamentary and 2012 presidential elections, some fiscal loosening is likely, which would be unhelpfully procyclical. Growth prospects would be robust to a small fall in oil prices from the levels assumed in this projection, but a large decline would pose a significant downside risk.</p>

The underlying assumptions regarding revenues are probably too cautious, and the outcome may therefore be somewhat better than budgeted. Nonetheless, given the favourable external environment and a cyclical recovery that is picking up steam, a more ambitious profile of fiscal consolidation should be implemented. This would not only safeguard fiscal sustainability but also contribute to raising national savings, reducing upward pressure on the exchange rate and crowding in private investment. Restraint in public sector wage increases would be one measure that would both contribute to fiscal consolidation and help establish a norm of wage moderation which would encourage private sector employment growth. This would complement other government measures to boost employment, which rightly remain a very high priority.</p>

The output gap is projected to narrow only gradually, remaining negative throughout 2011-12, and the unemployment rate is expected to be still above 20% at end-2012. Headline inflation will trend downwards on a quarterly basis through the projection period as the effects of the food and energy price surge dissipate.</p>

For example, higher-than-projected commodity prices or capital inflows would provide further impetus to domestic demand. Prominent downside risks include the possibility that recent weakness in house prices continues, undermining household wealth and consumption growth. Another uncertainty relates to electricity supply – the crisis provided an interlude of lower demand, but now capacity margins are shrinking again and significant new capacity remains some way off, creating a significant risk of power supply constraining growth within the next two years.</p>

Based on a technical exercise, this chapter considers macroeconomic prospects for OECD economies to the middle of the next decade and the challenges and the associated risks. The projections described in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapters" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/> <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chaptersand" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/> suggest that nearly all OECD economies are expected to improve their fiscal balances over the course of this year and next. However, for many this will still leave fiscal balances too weak to stabilise government debt and for others, where debt is stable, it will be at levels which remain too high. Moreover, this chapter also discusses whether the crisis could have a long-lasting adverse effect on the growth rate of output, particularly as a consequence of large fiscal imbalances or continuing financial fragilities, and so lead to a prolonged period of stagnation. An alternative risk of <shortcitation>stagflation</shortcitation> – stagnation combined with inflation – might arise as a consequence of continuing upward pressure on oil and other commodity prices. These risks are examined in the context of previous historical episodes of stagnation and the implications for policy are considered.</p>

In Japan and the United States, stabilising the debt-to-GDP ratio would require an overall improvement in the underlying primary balance of 10 to 11 percentage points of GDP from the 2010 position, implying a protracted period of fiscal tightening. Other countries for which consolidation requirements are large include Greece, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom, which all require consolidation of about 6 to 8½ percentage points of GDP from the 2010 position. In addition, for a typical OECD country, additional offsets of 3% of GDP will have to be found over the coming 15 years to meet spending pressures due to increasing pension and health care costs.</p>

In the case of Japan there is a medium-term plan, but it is not sufficiently ambitious. In the United States, there are a number of fiscal plans, but political disagreement makes the extent, pace and instruments of future consolidation very uncertain. For most other countries where consolidation needs are most severe, official medium-term consolidation plans more than match the requirements to stabilise debt, so that the achievement of such plans would put the debt ratio on a downward path. Nevertheless, in some of these cases the credibility of such plans needs to be enhanced by clearly specifying which spending and revenue instruments will be adjusted.</p>

In contrast, a previous banking crisis in Japan in the 1990s ushered in a prolonged period of stagnation, characterised by low productivity growth, which was partly due to a failure to deal promptly with non-performing bank loans. In the current conjuncture this underlines the importance of resolving outstanding banking problems, especially in Europe where financial weakness and a lack of transparency about exposures represent a risk of stagnation.</p>

Previous episodes of stagnation have led to an acceleration in debt accumulation, but there is also a risk that deteriorating debt positions may adversely affect trend growth. This underlines the importance of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt levels below thresholds where there might be risks to trend growth as well as to create fiscal space for dealing with future shocks.</p>

In this respect, countries face a difficult choice between front-loaded fast consolidation and more gradual consolidation. Fast consolidation has the advantage that it may reduce the overall scale of required consolidation and reassure financial markets, but it also increases the risk of adversely affecting the recovery particularly if monetary policy is constrained. To improve the terms of this trade-off, countries should put greater weight on measures which will improve long-term fiscal sustainability – for example raising retirement ages or containing future increases in health costs – but which have relatively limited immediate negative effects on demand. To reassure financial markets, it is also important to have a clear medium-term fiscal plan specifying objectives and the instruments that will be used. Consolidation should also avoid measures, such as reducing public investment or support for R&amp;D, which weaken the supply side and instead target measures which strengthen it.</p>

This represents a loss of more than a year’s growth for the region as a whole. Underlying the loss are reductions in capital endowment as firms have adjusted to the end of cheap financing and increases in long-duration unemployment resulting in hysteresis-type effects leading to higher structural unemployment.</p>

Most of the assumptions underlying the scenario tend to be relatively optimistic – beginning with the proposition that the crisis itself only reduces the level of potential output and has no permanent adverse effect on its growth rate and by the assumption that fiscal consolidation does not affect growth. Output gaps are also generally assumed to close by 2015 as a result of sustained above-trend growth with output growing in line with potential thereafter. In a few countries where the output gap in 2012 is exceptionally large, such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the output gap takes longer to close (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs01"/>).

For a few countries, Chile, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, the structural unemployment estimates are based on a Hodrick-Prescott filter of unemployment. Over the post-crisis period a hysteresis effect is imposed on the structural unemployment rate which is then assumed to eventually return to pre-crisis levels but at a speed which differs across countries based on previous historical experience (Guichard and Rusticelli, 2010); for those countries with more flexible labour markets structural unemployment returns to pre-crisis levels by 2018 and for other countries by 2026.</p>

Policy changes to encourage domestic demand in surplus countries and policies to encourage saving in deficit countries can do much to alleviate global imbalances. OECD work on structural policy reform provides guidance in removing distortions that contribute to imbalances. For surplus countries – such as China – this includes removing the incentive for precautionary savings that come from weak government social safety nets – including medical services and retirement pensions, as well as establishing a legal framework facilitating the development of the domestic financial system. In OECD countries, this includes removing incentives for greater consumption in deficit countries (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>in the United States) and to stimulate investment and capital inflows by implementing product market reforms in surplus countries (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>in Japan and some European economies). In addition, fiscal consolidation in deficit countries would also be helpful.</p>

This relatively modest pace of consolidation – assumed to be ½ per cent of GDP per annum reduction in the underlying primary balance from 2013 maintained for as long as it takes to stabilise debt – means that in many cases there is a further build-up in the ratio of government debt to GDP before it levels off. This makes the requirements for consolidation more challenging still, since debt build-up requires more servicing and thus a higher primary balance to stabilise debt. Moreover, as discussed below, an important factor tending to further increase consolidation requirements is that the differential between interest rates and growth rises over the projection. On the other hand, the effects on fiscal balances from population ageing and continued upward pressures on health costs are not explicitly included in the projection, but these will also add to consolidation pressures (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs02"/>).</p>

On the basis of unchanged policies, and generally conservative assumptions, increases in public spending on health care, long-term care and pensions over the next 15 years are estimated to amount to between 1% and 6% of GDP in the OECD area, largely as a result of ageing (see Table). In the typical OECD country, about two-thirds of that change is coming from health and long-term care expenditures.</p>
              <p id="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-05-p0040" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Public expenditure on pensions has been growing faster than national income for the past 20 years and is expected to continue to do so over coming decades. Ageing populations are putting pressure on public pensions which are increasing in all but four OECD countries where data are available, amounting to 1% of GDP by 2025 on average. Nevertheless, as a consequence of past pension reforms, which lower benefits and increase the age of retirement, the rate of growth of pension expenditure will be much slower than demographic change alone would have implied. There is, however, scope for further reform. In particular, although half of all OECD countries have, or will be, increasing statutory pension ages, in all but a handful the projected gains in life expectancy over the next four decades are expected to exceed the prospective increase in pension ages (OECD, 2011).</p>
              <p id="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-05-p0041" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">For the average country the increase in public health and long-term care spending over the next 15 years of about 2 percentage points of GDP is about double that for pensions. This is on the basis of a so called <shortcitation>cost-pressure</shortcitation> scenario in which, on top of demographic effects, expenditures are assumed to grow 1% per annum faster than income, which would be broadly consistent with observed trends over the past two decades. This reflects rapidly rising health-care prices and developments of new and costly treatment which put upward pressure on health-care budgets. Spending on health care is already one of the largest public spending items, accounting for more than 15% of general government spending on average in the OECD in 2007 (equal to more than 6% of GDP), up from 12% in 1995. OECD analysis, comparing the efficiency of health systems across different countries, suggests that there is considerable potential for efficiency gains; estimates suggest that public spending reduction could amount to 2% of GDP on average for the OECD area and over 3% of GDP for Greece, Ireland and the United Kingdom (Joumard<emphasis emph="italic"> et al.</emphasis>, 2010).</p>

Other countries for which consolidation requirements are large just to stabilise debt before the middle of the next decade include Greece, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom, which all require consolidation of about 6 to 8½ percentage points of GDP from the 2010 position. Given the large improvement in the underlying primary balance which is projected to occur between 2010 and 2012, no further consolidation beyond 2012 is required for Portugal, and consolidation of only 1½ to 2 additional percentage points of GDP is required for Greece and the Slovak Republic beyond 2012. For the other countries – Ireland, Poland and the United Kingdom – a further consolidation of 3 to 4½ percentage points of GDP beyond 2012 is required to stabilise debt.</p>

In general, faster consolidation implies that debt stabilises at a lower level, causing lower debt service and requiring less overall consolidation. As an illustrative example, Ireland requires seven years of consolidation beyond 2012 to stabilise debt in the baseline scenario in which 0.5% of GDP consolidation per year is assumed, implying total consolidation of 3½ percentage points of GDP. Alternatively, in a variant scenario in which there is more rapid consolidation of 1.5% of GDP per year, only two years of consolidation are needed to stabilise debt, implying total consolidation of only 3 percentage points of GDP. However, this result needs to be qualified, because rapid consolidation runs the risk of having a larger cumulative adverse effect on GDP than gradual consolidation, particularly over a period when any offsetting response from monetary policy may be constrained, and this in turn would reduce any difference in the total consolidation required.</p>

During the years prior to the crisis, this differential between interest rates and growth was unusually favourable to restraining the build-up of debt; the differential between long-term interest rates on government bonds and nominal potential growth was negative for many OECD economies, compared to an average positive differential of over 200 basis points over the 1980s and 1990s (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-08-g001"/>). The pre-crisis differential was low mainly because interest rates across the maturity spectrum were unusually low, partly the result of global factors including lower inflation pressures (Bernanke, 2005). Policy rates were also very low for much of this period.</p>

However, as output gaps close and financial conditions and policy rates begin to normalise and quantitative easing is unwound, the interest rate-growth differential is expected to increase thereby adding to the pressures on debt accumulation. This partly reflects a reversion to historical norms. In addition, the differential might rise because high and rising government debt adds upward pressure on long-term government bond yields. There is a large and controversial empirical literature that examines the impact of public deficits and debt on long-term government bond yields.<fnote id="OCDEid1065335"><p id="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-08-p0046" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See Box 4.5 in OECD (2010b) for a selective survey.</p></fnote> Drawing on this literature, for the purpose of the current exercise it is assumed that when gross government indebtedness passes a threshold of 75% of GDP then long-term interest rates increase by 4 basis points for every additional percentage point increase in the government debt-to-GDP ratio – an assumption consistent with, for example, the findings of Égert (2010) and Laubach (2009).<fnote id="OCDEid1065378"><p id="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-08-p0047" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Égert (2010) finds that the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates appear to be a non-linear function of public debt for the G7 countries (excluding Japan) in recent years. The estimation results indicate a 4 basis point increase in long-term rates relative to short-term rates for each percentage point of GDP in public debt above 76%. Laubach (2009) focuses on the United States and finds that long-term yields increase about 25 basis points per percentage point increase in the projected deficit-to-GDP ratio, and 3 to 4 basis points per percentage point increase in
the debt-to-GDP ratio.</p></fnote></p>

The extent of fiscal consolidation needs to be much larger if the aim is to significantly reduce debt-to-GDP ratios, rather than merely stabilise them. Such a reduction would avoid high debt levels and associated high interest rates undermining economic growth and provide a safety margin for public finances to tackle future shocks. Calculations of the cumulative improvement in the primary balance that would be required from 2010 to reduce debt either to pre-crisis (2007) levels or to 60% of GDP by 2026 imply a much greater consolidation effort than to merely stabilise the debt ratio; for the OECD as a whole, on top of the 7 percentage points of GDP to stabilise debt, they imply additional consolidation of 5¼ and 7 percentage points of GDP, respectively (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-11-g002"/>).</p>

In Belgium and Italy, the deficit targets are closer to balance, but this is warranted to ensure that the debt ratio is put on a clear downward trajectory given the higher initial level of debt. However, for all of the aforementioned countries, detailed consolidation measures to achieve these targets need to be specified to enhance the credibility of the consolidation plan.</p>

The stagnation spells ends in the first year in which that country’s real income is at least 1% higher than it was in the previous year and at least 1% lower than in the subsequent year. The authors found that real income stagnation has affected a large number of countries: 103 out of 168 in their sample during the period 1960 to 2001. Recent stagnation spells in OECD countries include Greece (1981-87), Iceland (1990-94), New Zealand (1988-92) and Switzerland (1992-96).</p></fnote> Using potential output eliminates cyclical fluctuations and, although the 1% treshold and the minimum length of spells are arbitrary, the criterion is stringent enough to ensure that the stagnation episodes identified will be both protracted and severe. Applying this criterion to all OECD countries over the period 1995 to 2009 identifies three different episodes: Japan from 1997 to 2002; Portugal from 2003 to 2009; and Italy from 2004 to 2009.</p>

Although the problem of bad loans was already obvious by 1992-93 when the non-bank housing loan companies (<emphasis emph="italic">jusen</emphasis>) became insolvent, the authorities chose to adopt a wait-and-see approach because of the large scale of under-capitalisation and insolvency problems in the banking sector. The start of the stagnation episode in 1997 coincides with a sharp escalation of the crisis as a large bank and two large securities firms failed. Share prices of weaker institutions fell, mild bank runs occurred and interbank lending seized up. The resulting credit crunch led to a fall in investment and a cutback in consumption, which in turn fed into weaker growth and further cuts in credit, with the resulting downturn being given further impetus by the Asian crisis in 1997/98.</p>

However, recovery of the sector was slow. Competition was distorted by extensive deposit insurance, regulatory forbearance in enforcing capital adequacy rules and lending growth requirements to the SME sector. This allowed even the worst banks to continue raising funds and meant lending standards were not rigorously applied (Hoshi and Kashyap, 2004). The poor performance of the banking sector and the poor discrimination between competing demands for funding by firms may explain some of the decline in the growth of total factor productivity over the stagnation period compared to the previous decade (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDBCFAD"/>).</p>

The latter include allowing the economy to slip into a period of deflation, from which it has subsequently been very difficult to escape. An additional contributory factor depressing growth over this period is a decline in the ratio of the working-age to total population (the <shortcitation>demographic support ratio</shortcitation> in <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDBCFAD"/>) as a result of ageing, which subtracted more than ½ per cent per annum from GDP per capita growth over the stagnation episode.</p>

During the five years leading up to monetary union, the nominal long-term interest fell by more than 5 percentage points in Portugal (as well as in Italy and Spain), compared with an average of around 3 percentage points for the euro area as a whole. From 1995 to 2000, the current account deficit rose from virtually zero to more than 10% of GDP as households borrowed massively to finance both consumption and housing (household indebtedness reached 103% of disposable income in 2002 from 39% in 1995). This borrowing fuelled domestic demand, and economic growth in Portugal averaged 4% during the five years to 2000, exceeding the euro area average by 1½ percentage points. When it became clear in the early 2000s that the expectations of continued rapid growth and catch-up on which the spending boom had been premised were not going to be realised, both personal and corporate saving went up and consumption and investment fell sharply, triggering a slowdown, which, combined with a tightening of the fiscal stance, morphed into stagnation. The contribution of growth in capital per worker to growth in potential output per capita fell sharply over the stagnation episode: from 1.3 percentage points on average in the decade to 2003 to only 0.4 percentage points per year over the stagnation episode (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDBCFAD"/>).</p>

Relative to its OECD peers, in 2003 Portugal had low educational attainment, low upper-secondary graduation rates, high public ownership and state control of business operations, restrictive barriers to entry in numerous industries, restrictive regulation in some sectors (such as transport, gas and retail), a relatively high cost of labour, an onerous marginal tax wedge on labour for high earners, strict employment protection legislation and low public support to R&amp;D. The resulting rigidities and the absence of reforms have meant losses in competitiveness as new big players like China increasingly competed with traditional Portuguese exports and businesses were not able to move up the quality chain. This lack of competitiveness has contributed to the economy remaining depressed for many years and is reflected in slower growth in the capital-labour ratio after the credit boom ended.</p>

Rather, the slowdown in potential growth was long in the making and involved a long-term decline in investment and in trend productivity growth that started in the early 1990s (OECD, 2009a). Such trends are most easily ascribed to weak structural policy settings, which may also have made Italy more vulnerable to shocks or to significant economic changes and thus more likely to experience stagnation. Italy compares poorly against other OECD countries in respect of educational attainment, public ownership and state involvement in business operations, administrative burdens on entrepreneurship, legal barriers to entry in industries, barriers to foreign direct investment, the restrictiveness of regulations in certain sectors (road, post, professional services), marginal tax wedges on labour and protection for collective dismissals. Such weaknesses have contributed to a persistent and pronounced trend deterioration in measures of competitiveness based on relative unit labour costs. They have also been reflected in a deterioration in the contribution of total factor productivity growth to potential output per capita growth during the stagnation years as well as weaker growth in the capital-labour ratio.</p>

This is in line with the average experience following past banking crises (Cerra and Saxena, 2008; Furceri and Mourougane, 2009; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009; Abiad <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2009). There is, however, considerable heterogeneity among individual country episodes, including some where there have been longer-lasting adverse effects on growth rates as illustrated by the Japanese stagnation episode referred to above. Analysing the consequences of six severe OECD banking crises, Haugh, Ollivaud and Turner (2009) find that only in the case of Japan is there evidence of a reduction in the potential growth rate which they attribute to the protracted nature of the banking problems and the resulting misallocation of capital. In the context of the current crisis, this highlights the importance of resolving outstanding banking problems, especially in Europe where a combination of financial weakness and lack of transparency about exposures by some financial institutions represent a downside risk to the outlook (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs03"/>).</p>

Although the circumstances of the current financial crisis are unique and often country-specific, they share several important parallels with the Nordic (Sweden, Finland and Norway) and the Japanese financial crises of the early 1990s. In both cases, bursting financial asset and property bubbles led to financial turmoil and to recessions. However, the policy responses to the crises were very different:</p>

This approach has often been described as <shortcitation>forbearance and time</shortcitation>; <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>regulators ignore banks’ solvency problems and allow them to make up for unrecognised losses through time (Blundell-Wignall and Slovik, 2011). Consequently, the Japanese crisis dragged on unresolved for the entire 1990s, often referred to in Japan as the <shortcitation>lost decade</shortcitation>. NPLs reached a peak of 9% of total loans only in 2003 and the banking sector recovered only by 2005.</p>

                  <p id="OCDEid1152335" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In contrast, in Nordic, governments requested insolvent banks to recognise losses promptly and to transfer bad assets to state-owned asset management companies at book value (OECD, 2009b). Existing shareholders were wiped out and the government took direct ownership of the banks. NPLs in the Nordic countries peaked at around 9% already between 1992 and 1993. The crisis was resolved by 1994, after which business and consumer confidence retuned and the economy recovered.</p>

              <p id="OCDEid1152347" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">NPLs in most OECD countries increased rapidly during the recent crisis (Table). It has been particularly apparent in countries that had property bubbles (Ireland, Spain and the United States), in Greece since the start of the sovereign debt crisis, and in Iceland, which faced a massive banking crisis. NPLs increased as well in other major OECD countries that were not directly affected by domestic property or sovereign debt crises (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom), while banking systems outside of the United States and Europe Japan and Canada) appear to have been affected to a much lesser extent.</p>

The Irish Financial Measures Programme conducted in early 2011 recognised a further capital shortage of e 24 billion on top of the measures already taken last year (Central Bank of Ireland, 2011). Recapitalisation efforts are also underway in Spain, where in early 2011 the Banco de España required the banking sector to increase its capital base by at least a further e 15 billion (Banco de España, 2011).</p>

Results from a relatively small literature suggest a negative impact on growth once government debt passes a certain threshold, typically around 75% or 90% of GDP. In Reinhart and Rogoff (2010), the median real per capita GDP growth rate in advanced economies falls by one percentage point when gross public debt reaches 90% of GDP and average growth falls even more. In Kumar and Woo (2010), each 10 percentage point increase in the gross debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with a slowdown in annual real per-capita GDP growth of about 0.15-0.2 percentage points per year for advanced economies, the effect being larger when debt goes above 90% of GDP. Applying these results in a ready reckoner fashion to compute the effect of the recent and projected build-up of government debt can lead to rather alarming conclusions: if applied to the baseline projections described above for the OECD area as whole, the estimates imply a loss in the trend GDP growth rate of ½-¾ percentage point. Moreover, many OECD countries would appear vulnerable with the gross debt-to-GDP ratio in more than half of all OECD countries projected to rise above 75% and in nearly one-third of OECD countries above 90%. The transmission mechanism by which this occurs is likely to involve higher interest rates and a crowding out of private investment and R&amp;D, with adverse consequences for trend productivity growth.</p>

For example, the three episodes of stagnation analysed above, all resulted in a much faster accumulation of government debt (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDBCFAD"/>) – but in each case the direction of causation seems to suggest more strongly that stagnation was a cause of the more rapid build-up in government debt rather than a consequence.</p>

          <p id="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-12-p0086" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">There is unfortunately a trade-off between slowing the accumulation of government debt to stave off its possible negative effect on growth, and the risks that fiscal consolidation itself may create sustained headwinds on the recovery and lead to stagnation. The size of the adverse demand effects will vary by country and depend on the size of the initial fiscal imbalance, the credibility of fiscal consolidation plans, the scope to cut policy interest rates, the fiscal instruments used and the speed of consolidation. Countries face particularly difficult choices regarding the speed of consolidation and the instruments to use, but both provide opportunities to minimise the negative demand effects from consolidation. Fiscal consolidation should be more rapid if there is scope for monetary policy to offset some of the negative demand effects. If the recovery proceeds at the projected pace, the constraints on monetary policy should be less of a concern from 2012 onwards for most countries and the pace of normalisation of interest rates could be then adjusted to partially offset any economic weakness resulting from budget improvements. The contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation could also be partially offset to the extent that credible programmes reduce the risk of sovereign debt defaults, reducing risk premia on government securities which in turn reduce interest rates more generally. Lower long-term interest rates can in turn help boost output in the long-run by raising investment and productivity. These positive expectational effects that work through financial markets are greater the more clear and credible medium-term fiscal plans are regarding the objectives and the instruments that will be used.</p>

For instance, raising the retirement age can at the same time reduce long-term fiscal pressures and have a positive impact on potential output from higher labour force participation of older people. It may even raise aggregate demand in the short run as people need to save less for shorter retirement periods. Consolidation should also avoid measures, such as reducing public investment or support for R&amp;D, which weaken the supply side and instead target measures which strengthen it. OECD (2010b) has a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of different fiscal consolidation instruments on both the revenue and spending sides.</p>

Sharp rises in oil and commodity prices combined with macroeconomic policy mistakes led to stagflation in the 1970s. By draining away funds that consumers would otherwise spend on other things, high oil prices reduce consumption and demand in the short run (see <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>). But high oil prices can affect the economy’s supply side as well. They signify greater intensity in the use of other inputs (labour and capital) which are available only in inelastic or limited elastic supply, implying a fall in productive potential. Previous OECD estimates based on a four-factor Cobb-Douglas production approach (OECD, 2008) suggest that a doubling of real oil prices would reduce the steady-state <emphasis emph="italic">level</emphasis> of output by about 1¾ per cent in the United States and about 1¼ per cent in other (less energy-intensive) OECD economies.<fnote id="OCDEid1065624"><p id="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-14-p0089" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">These estimates are likely to exaggerate the long-run costs of higher energy prices because they assume fixed factor shares and do not allow for changes in technology in response to changing relative factor prices. </p></fnote> Assuming the shock was in the form of a trend increase in the growth rate of real oil prices, so for example real oil prices doubled over the course of a decade, the medium-term effects of rising real oil prices could reduce the growth rate by 0.1-0.2 percentage points per annum. Still, it seems more likely that rising real oil prices would be a contributory factor to stagnation rather than a principal cause, especially if attendant revenues accruing to oil-producing countries are recycled into safe government securities in major OECD countries, so lowering long-term interest rates.</p>

No OECD country is expected to have such a large demographic drag on the growth of potential output per capita as Japan has been experiencing over the past decade, but in nearly all OECD countries a falling demographic support ratio is expected to start pulling per capita growth down within the next ten years. Looking at the 2020-25 period where the demographic effect will be most significant, the drag on annual growth in potential output per capita will be ¼ percentage point per annum or more for several countries. On the other hand, policy changes, especially in public pension provision, and economic necessity may push up the old-age participation rate and increase the average retirement age, offsetting some of the projected impact, which effectively assumes that the maximum age of the working population is fixed at 65.</p>

In the case of Italy it can be argued that this was the underlying cause of stagnation as manifest in the trend deterioration in competitiveness. In the case of Portugal, it may have made it more difficult for the economy to recover from the consequences of a severe shock (in this case the ending of a credit boom). A combination of structural and fiscal reforms thus constitutes the best strategy to reduce the risks that the weak growth observed in many OECD countries in the post-crisis period will turn into stagnation.</p>

OECD research has shown that a gradual alignment to OECD best practices of product market regulations, job protection legislation, unemployment benefit systems, activation policies, labour taxes and pension systems could boost aggregate labour productivity levels by several per cent over the next decade in many OECD countries, with large continental European countries such as Italy having the largest benefits to reap from reforms (Bouis and Duval, 2011). By raising potential growth, such reforms would at the same time facilitate fiscal consolidation and help tackle some of the specific legacies of the recession, not least weakness in labour markets that could otherwise turn out to be more persistent and cause higher structural unemployment than assumed in the baseline (see <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-C04-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>).</p>

At the end of 2010, the average OECD unemployment rate was still close to the historical peak reached during the crisis. In 12 OECD countries it remained two percentage points or more above the pre-crisis level, and even where the rise in joblessness was less severe, the recovery has been generally too weak so far to allow for a significant fall in unemployment (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-04-g001"/>). A main concern in countries most severely hit is that persistently high levels of unemployment – and a rising share of unemployed workers facing long spells without a job – will eventually result in widespread deterioration of human capital, discouragement and labour market withdrawal.

Given the slack remaining in economic activity and labour utilisation, together with still-anchored inflation expectations, aggregate demand policies have a role to play in supporting the economic recovery and stimulate jobs. Indeed, monetary policy remains strongly expansionary in most OECD countries whereas unsustainable public debt path in several of them has necessitated a turn towards fiscal consolidation. Recommendations in the area of macro policies are discussed at length in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>. This chapter focuses on the role of structural policies even if the budgetary implications of specific options are taken into account in the discussion regarding the appropriate policy mix.</p>

The ability of these countries to cushion the employment impact of the crisis may offer lessons that could help improve labour market resilience to future shocks.

Among the policies that can stimulate labour demand, measures to reduce labour costs through temporary and targeted tax wedge reductions are likely to be most effective. Indeed, such measures have already been put in place in several countries, though not always in a cost-efficient way.</p>

As the risk of missing a job opportunity by suspending job search to enrol in training is lower in periods of labour market slack, there is a case for strengthening vocational training given the high rate of unemployment among youth and low skilled. Such training could also provide a surrogate test for participants’ willingness to work. However, in countries where the financial space for manoeuvre is limited by severe budget constraints (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain), stepping up training programmes may be difficult, and this could also be the case in countries that do not have the sufficient training infrastructure in place (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>the United States).</p>

Continued extension may also help avoid that the unemployed enter other benefit systems (such as disability pensions) from which exit may be less likely later on. In the meantime, benefits should be made conditional on recipients satisfying job-search requirements and, where benefits are relatively high, they could be made declining with duration. On the other hand, where the scope of unemployment insurance has been extended to workers previously not covered, as for instance in Finland, Japan and the Slovak Republic, the extensions should be made permanent both for social reasons and to maintain the labour force attachments of groups newly covered, provided again that job-search requirement can be enforced on these new beneficiaries.</p>

The significant role played by these programmes in cushioning the crisis – especially in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Japan and Luxembourg – suggests that having such options in place and being able to activate them in severe downturns, can be useful. Such short-time working arrangements should include, as for instance in Germany and the Netherlands, built-in incentives for workers and firms to withdraw from them once they have outlived their conjunctural purpose. And, insofar as the schemes do not have sufficient auto-corrective incentives, a timeframe should be set for the phasing-out of public subsidies so as to avoid negative long-term effects on productivity and labour utilisation.</p>

However, given that tight employment protection provisions – whose costs are often high and unpredictable for employers – reduce outflows from unemployment, there is now a case for streamlining such provisions, especially where substantial risks of unemployment persistence prevail. In particular, <shortcitation>two-tier</shortcitation> systems entailing large differences in protection across different types of contracts – which have contributed to labour market duality in countries like France, Italy and Spain – may have generated unemployment turnover for certain categories of workers (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>youth and women) with no permanent effects on the unemployment rate. Narrowing, or eliminating, differences in contract provisions across workers, for instance so that protection rises with seniority, could boost hiring during the recovery while at the same time improving labour market resilience to future shocks and lowering the unemployment rate in the longer term.</p>

To some extent this reflected differences in the degree of exposure to specific features of the crisis, such as the aftermath of financial and housing market bubbles and the associated contractions in the construction and finance industries. However, the variations in outcomes also reflected differences in policy settings, resulting from both policies in place before the crisis and measures implemented in response to the crisis (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs01"/>). These differences notwithstanding, considering the magnitude of the recession, the labour market fallout from the crisis has been relatively benign in the majority of countries, and this is due in large measure to past reforms. </p>

To some extent, this broad improvement in unemployment resulted from labour market reforms implemented in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In a few cases, this has made the labour market more adaptable to macroeconomic conditions, but these reforms have also added to segmentation between permanent employees enjoying stronger job protection, and a growing share of temporary workers bearing the brunt of workforce adjustment (OECD, 2006; Saint-Paul, 1996; Boeri, 2010).</p>

While there were virtually no changes in provisions to extend administratively bargaining outcomes to non-covered parties, some countries have implemented reforms aimed at changing workers’ representation mechanisms and allow firms to opt out of collective agreements in certain cases. As a result of this and, especially, of an increasingly competitive global and domestic environment, some movement towards decentralisation of wage bargaining has taken place in many countries. Indeed, the period of wage moderation observed in Germany during the 2000s is to some extent an illustration of the greater flexibility firms have had in adjusting collective wage agreements so as to better reflect local conditions.</p>

Hence, in addition to macroeconomic measures, all governments introduced different labour market measures aiming at three broad objectives: smooth the employment impact of the output shock (perceived as temporary) by subsidising jobs, encouraging the adjustment to occur in hours worked, and stimulating labour demand; facilitate the re-employment of unemployed workers (or those at strong risk of losing their job) <emphasis emph="italic">via</emphasis> training and other re-deployment measures; and cushion the impact of the shock on the income of the unemployed through extended income-support measures:<boxnoteref refid="CHDEBADE" format="boxnoteref"/></p>

In several cases pre-existing schemes just expanded, while in others new schemes were established. In some countries these measures complemented spontaneous private-sector adjustment in average hours worked and their implementation was facilitated by collective bargaining arrangements (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Germany). Overall, this led to an increase in the average stock of employees participating in such schemes by more than 2% of all employees in 5 countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Japan and Luxembourg). Other measures such as public-sector job creation or private-sector job subsidies and reductions in non-wage labour costs were implemented in at least half of OECD countries.</p>

But some of the policy interventions may nevertheless unduly contribute to delay adjustments in the workforce if maintained for too long. Indeed, many of the measures introduced in 2009 were meant to be temporary and a few countries have partially or fully withdrawn some of them, notably the reductions in non-wage labour costs and the subsidies for short-time work. However, the vast majority of countries kept the measures in place in 2010 and in some new ones were brought in, such as for instance a payroll tax cut implemented for 2011 in the United States.</p>

In the majority of countries, total hours worked declined less than GDP as the output shock was partly absorbed through labour hoarding (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-g002"/>). In a few countries (Iceland, Spain and the United States), however, hourly productivity gains were substantial as a consequence of a decline in total hours.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-n00"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-p0031" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In both Spain and the United States, productivity growth over the period exceeded trend estimates. Even though hourly productivity gains have been frequently observed during previous recessions in the United States the extent of the increase in 2008-09 has been surprisingly strong (Wilson, 2010). </p></fnote> These gains reflect to some extent composition effects since job losses were largely concentrated in low-productivity sectors such as construction (OECD, 2009). At the same time, those countries that recorded the largest decline in total hours have generally done so primarily <emphasis emph="italic">via</emphasis> lower head-count employment (Denmark, Ireland, Iceland, Spain and the United States) (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-g003"/>). At the other end of the spectrum, the reduction in total hours has been almost entirely absorbed through adjustments in average hours per worker in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Korea and Luxembourg. A substantial contribution of average hours worked to total labour input adjustment has been a recurrent feature of past recessions in several countries (including Belgium and Germany),
but the widespread use of short-time work arrangements on a scale as large as that observed during the recent crisis was unprecedented.</p>

Concerns about unemployment persistence are particularly pronounced in countries that have experienced large increases in long-term unemployment. The longer individuals remain unemployed, the more difficult it becomes for them to find a job and the less they may try, a phenomenon referred to as unemployment duration dependence or hysteresis.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-03-n01"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-03-p0036" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">This phenomenon may be due to a variety of more or less related factors such as the erosion of skills (Pissarides, 1992), discrimination by employers (Lockwood, 1991) and the ranking of job applicants by employers on the basis of their time spent in unemployment (Blanchard and Diamond, 1994). Another factor potentially reinforcing these effects is the reluctance of unemployed workers to adjust downward their reservation wage even as their spells lengthen, which to some extent can reflect a rise in social tolerance <emphasis emph="italic">vis-à-vis</emphasis> the status of long-term unemployment (Lindbeck, 1995).</p></fnote> In at least ten countries (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Canada, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States) the share of long-term unemployment has risen significantly during the crisis, pointing to a significant risk of hysteresis (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-06-g004"/>).</p>

Indeed, the substantial slack in labour productivity and average hours worked that has built up in the wake of the crisis has provided ample room in the majority of countries for accommodating GDP growth through more intense use of currently employed workers. Furthermore, even though GDP is generally expected to grow in 2011 and 2012 faster than productivity and the labour force combined, in several cases the slack may be absorbed too slowly to allow for a significant decline in unemployment over this horizon. Only when growth garners sufficient momentum, unemployment will begin to recede more rapidly and eventually returns to its longer-term or structural level.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-04-n02"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-04-p0038" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Employment usually lags activity during recoveries as businesses tend to delay investment and hiring decisions until growth prospects look sufficiently robust and labour hoarding has been eliminated.</p></fnote></p>

In most countries, wages decelerated sharply, with the adjustment taking place one or two quarters after the recession began. Arguably, that wages reacted moderately to the severity of the output contraction was helpful to limit the risks of deflation at the trough of the recession, as this would have further complicated the task of demand policies. Still, the slowdown in wages in late 2009 and early 2010, combined with a rebound in productivity, was sufficient to bring about a deceleration in unit labour costs (and even a decline in several countries) which helped stem employment losses (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-06-g005"/>). In addition, measures were taken in several countries to reduce the non-wage component of labour costs, notably through targeted cuts in payroll taxes. It remains unclear whether or not the resulting overall adjustment in labour costs has been sufficient to support sustained employment growth in the near term.</p>

While both higher inflow rates and lower outflow rates contributed to the rise in unemployment in the initial phase of the crisis, at this stage of the recovery the risk of persistence is largely determined by the evolution of the outflow rate. One reason is that after rising at the onset of the crisis, the inflow rate has since fallen back towards pre-crisis levels in a majority of countries (suggesting that there are no longer net job losses across the economy). In contrast, the outflow rate has generally remained depressed (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-06-g006"/>), in some cases at very low levels by historical standards, not least in the United States (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs02"/>).<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-06-n03"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-06-p0041" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The measured outflow rates shown in <xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-06-g006"/> do not distinguish between exits into jobs and withdrawals from the labour force. </p></fnote> This has resulted in a steady lengthening of average unemployment duration.

Since inflows into unemployment have also been falling in parallel, the trend decline in outflow rates had not led to an increase in the aggregate unemployment rate. Nevertheless, the fact that the US outflow rate had already been fluctuating around a clear downward trend over the past three decades suggests that an eventual return to pre-crisis levels may be hampered by structural forces working in the opposite direction.</p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-06-p0050" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A recent analysis of the long-term increase in the average duration of unemployment spells in the United States found that shifts in the age structure of the pool of the unemployed, as well as an increase in the unemployment duration spells of women both played major roles, while other factors such as changes in the industrial structure have had little impact (Aaronson <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010). The demographic factor largely reflects a falling share of youth (who tend to have shorter unemployment spells) in the unemployment pool. The rise in the share of long-term unemployment among women need not be worrying insofar as it results from a stronger participation to the labour force and that it has coincided with a trend decline in their overall unemployment rate (Abraham and Shimmer, 2002). However, these factors together only explain about half of the particularly large increase in average duration in the recent episode. The unexplained part could raise policy concerns.</p>

Factors having an influence on matching efficiency include the degree of mismatch across regions or industrial sectors between job openings and workers looking for a job, as well as the overall intensity and effectiveness of the individual’s job search, which may diminish as the average unemployment spell lengthens.</p>

An oft-used gauge of matching efficiency is the relationship between open vacancies and unemployment (the so-called Beveridge curve) but it does not provide clear evidence concerning a shift during the crisis.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-08-n04"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-08-p0057" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">For instance, a recent analysis looking beyond the Beveridge curve has found that the outflow rate in the United States is significantly lower than what would be expected even taking into account the low availability of jobs relative to the number of unemployed, a development which could be interpreted as a decline in matching efficiency (Elsby <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2010). However, such an interpretation is premature considering that it is not unusual for a pick-up in job openings following a period of steady decline to be fully reflected in lower unemployment only a few quarters later (Yellen, 2010). </p></fnote> </p>

Important losses have also been recorded for many countries in wholesale and retail trade and financial intermediation. Manufacturing has since largely rebounded but construction has remained depressed in most countries where the sector enjoyed a boom before the crisis. And countries where the latter sector has been hardest hit (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Denmark, Ireland, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and, to a lesser extent, Portugal) are also the ones where the incidence of long-term unemployment has risen most.

While there are indications of a widening dispersion during the crisis, the rise in dispersion vanishes when the parallel increase in overall unemployment is taken into account (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-18-g008"/>), suggesting that the decline in the outflow rate bears little relationship with regional differences in unemployment. There have been concerns also that labour mobility may have decreased during the crisis. This could be the case if, for instance, geographical mobility is hampered by housing price developments that lead to negative home equity positions (Andrews <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011). However, recent evidence from the United States indicates, if anything, that homeowners with negative home equity positions have been moving slightly more than other homeowners (Schulhofer-Wohl, 2010).<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-11-n06"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-11-p0062" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">This result may be specific to the United States. First, the benefit of defaulting in the case of negative home equity position is generally higher than in most other countries, due to specific mortgage bankruptcy rules. Second, the incidence of strongly (as opposed to mildly) negative home equity position has been particularly high in the United States, which further increases the incentives to default. </p></fnote></p>

In this regard, a key concern is that as time goes by and unemployment spells lengthen, duration dependence – that the probability of leaving unemployment declines as an unemployment spell becomes longer – may take hold. Empirical evidence on duration dependence is mixed. For instance, one study using aggregate unemployment duration data found evidence of duration dependence in Japan, English-speaking and Nordic countries, but not in Continental European countries (Elsby <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2008).<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-n07"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-p0064" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">One limitation of the methodology and data used in Elsby <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2008) is that no control is made for the influence of the composition of the unemployment pool on observed duration dependence. Individuals with different characteristics such as age, gender or education level will generally enter an unemployment spell with different probabilities of exit which is independent from the spell duration. Therefore, it is possible that findings of duration dependence effects reflect a growing share of workers with intrinsically low exit rates in the unemployment pool as average duration increases, rather than a gradual decline over time in the probability of exit faced by individuals due to skill erosion or other hysteresis effects. </p></fnote> Empirical studies based on micro data have also found mixed evidence of pure duration dependence or hysteresis effects.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-n08"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-12-p0065" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See in particular Bover <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2002) and Garcia-Perez <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2010) in the case of Spain. Earlier studies reviewed
in Machin and Manning (1999) generally found little evidence of positive duration dependence in the case of several European countries. </p></fnote> However, more recent estimates based on individual level data point to more conclusive evidence of duration dependence effects in a sample covering a large number of OECD countries. And, these effects appear to be exacerbated by the duration of unemployment benefits (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs03"/> and related discussion in next section).</p>

              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-18-p0081" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Hysteresis refers to a situation where unemployment shows little tendency to revert to its previous level following an increase, regardless of the source and nature (temporary or permanent) of the shock causing the rise. In such a case, the distinction between the cyclical and trend components of unemployment rates may lose practical relevance. The risk of hysteresis has become a major concern, not least because of the social consequences for the individuals directly affected. Both hysteresis and its corollary – a high incidence of long-term unemployment – have plagued several continental European countries, going as far back as the 1980s. They have also become a concern in the United States since the recent crisis, following the unusually strong increase in the incidence of long-term unemployment (Aaronson <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010).</p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-18-p0082" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">There are different explanations for hysteresis. According to one, once workers become unemployed, they struggle to get back into employment regardless of the time they have spent in unemployment. In such a case, for a given job-seeker, the exit probability may have fallen at all unemployment durations, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>even for short-term unemployed. This could reflect an insufficient adjustment of the going wage rate. Another explanation focuses instead on the gradual erosion of skills associated with unemployment spells. The longer a worker remains unemployed, the less attractive he/she appears to employers. As he/she loses attractiveness, the motivation for intensive job search diminishes and the worker becomes more detached from the labour market. Under this explanation, there is a clear negative relationship between the probability of moving from unemployment to employment on the one hand, and the duration of an unemployment spell on the other, a pattern referred to as unemployment duration dependence.</p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-18-p0083" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The empirical analysis discussed in the remainder of this box focuses on the latter phenomenon, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>duration dependence (for details see Dantan and Murtin, 2011). Observations on individual unemployment spells are exploited to assess the influence of unemployment duration on the probability of moving from unemployment into a job. The dataset used is composed of 17 national panels of individuals whose monthly status on the labour market has been observed over the period 2005-07. These data show that in countries where the unemployment outflow rate is relatively high on average, it also tends to exhibit a steeper decline as durations increase. This is the case in general for English-speaking countries, Nordic countries and the Netherlands. In other words, the exit probability is much higher for short-term than long-term unemployed in these countries. Conversely, in countries where the average outflow rate is relatively low (a majority of continental European countries) it is also more stable across unemployment durations.</p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-18-p0084" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In principle, this finding could reflect differences in the composition of the unemployment pool at different durations rather than pure duration dependence effects. However, when applying a statistical method to control for composition effects, using observations on individual characteristics, pure duration dependence effects are found to account for about one-third of the decline in the rate of exit from unemployment to employment as unemployment duration increases. This represents an average and the proportion is higher in Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States than elsewhere.</p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-18-p0085" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The role of policies in mitigating or reinforcing the duration dependence effect can also be assessed in this framework. The influence of two types of policies has been examined more closely, namely the duration of unemployment benefits and spending on active labour market policies (ALMPs). As regards the former, several empirical studies have found a link between benefit duration and the average length of the unemployment spell (for a recent survey, see Krueger and Mueller, 2010). For example, recent estimates have suggested that the combined federal-state extension of benefit in the United States from 26 weeks to 99 weeks (or 90 weeks on a national average) in response to the crisis could, if maintained, raise the average length of the unemployment spell by between 1½ to 3 weeks corresponding to about ½ to 1 percentage point on the unemployment rate (Aaronson <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010). In addition, the unemployment exit rate has been found to increase sharply at the time benefits are exhausted (Katz and Meyer, 1990). The empirical analysis conducted for this study partly corroborates this evidence. Longer benefit duration appears to reinforce duration dependence effects on average across the countries in the sample.</p>

At the same time, falling labour force participation may to some extent be less of a concern for youth when the alternative is prolonged schooling, especially if this leads to genuine skills acquisition through a completed programme and a diploma (OECD, 2010b, Chapter 1).<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-15-n09"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-15-p0074" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Duval <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., (2010) also find that the sensitivity of youth participation to downturns increases with the ease of access to post-secondary education and can be up to 1½ percentage points higher in countries with generally higher enrolment rates.</p></fnote> However, there is no clear indication that the significant decline in youth participation observed in recent years has been associated with youth staying longer in education (OECD, 2010b).

In this regard, the fact that older workers have remained in the labour market during the latest recession (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-21-g009"/>, panel B) could in part be explained by reforms implemented in many countries and which have led to the closing of many benefit routes to early retirement. And, in contrast to recession episodes of the 1980s and 1990s, governments have not encouraged premature withdrawal of older workers in the vain hope of reducing youth unemployment according to a <shortcitation>lump of labour</shortcitation> view of the market. In some countries, the severe capital losses incurred by many private pension funds or individual early retirement savings schemes may have induced older workers to extend their active life in order to sustain prospective incomes (OECD, 2010c, Chapter 5). Relative to past recession episodes, all these factors point to diminished risks of labour force withdrawal among older workers despite the persistence of unemployment.</p>

Disability rates tend to increase in the wake of recessions, but then do not return to previous levels even after the economy has fully recovered (OECD, 2010d). Indeed, in a number of countries, unemployment peaks associated with recessions have tended to be followed by spikes in disability rates about two years later (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="OCDEid1010368"/>). Such a pattern is particularly visible in the United States, but some evidence can also be seen in Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The time lapse between high unemployment episodes and the subsequent hike in disability rates varies across countries and episodes but gaps of more than two years have often been seen in the past. Furthermore, in the majority of countries included in <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="OCDEid1010368"/>, disability rates have been on a trend rise over long periods, with, in some cases, accelerations in years following recessions.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-17-n11"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-17-p0078" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The exceptions are Finland, where disability rates have been brought below their early 1980s levels, as well as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom where the trend has been partly reversed during the 2000s.</p></fnote></p>

Many of the countries now facing a significant increase in long-term unemployment have previously experienced high or steadily rising disability rates (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Denmark, Ireland, the United States and to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom), which could suggest a risk of higher disability inflow going forward.</p>

One is the fact that older workers have not been as severely affected in the last recession as compared with earlier episodes. Since the probability of people aged between 50 and 64 years experiencing chronic health-related problems or disability is more than twice that of the total working-age population (OECD, 2010d), their relatively good employment performance during the recession should help lower the likelihood of a steep hike in disability enrolment in the near term.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-19-n12"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-19-p0088" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Older workers may be more vulnerable to stress-related factors associated with being unemployed in a period of weak labour market prospects. </p></fnote> Another mitigating factor is that many of the countries facing fast-rising disability rates following past recessions have taken measures to stem the <shortcitation>excess</shortcitation> flow of recipients and also, in some cases, to help existing recipients with work capacity to (re-)join the labour market.</p>

Several combinations of policies can achieve both aims, as illustrated in <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="OCDEid1010415"/>. However, not all policy options may be equally desirable once other factors or policy objectives are considered. For instance, timing is clearly important in the current context, which would favour policies that can exert a more rapid influence on unemployment outflows. Furthermore, policies that can reduce unemployment persistence may to varying degrees conflict with other objectives such as budgetary consolidation, labour force participation or social protection (in particular ensuring that unemployed workers currently facing bleak jobs prospect do not fall into poverty or lose attachment to the labour market). This raises a number of potential trade-offs, some of which are highlighted in <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="OCDEid1010519"/>.</p>

Income support to the unemployed serves several purposes, including providing social protection for individuals, promoting continued labour market participation of job losers and, possibly, enabling better matches of job seekers to jobs, especially when benefits are flanked by effective activation measures.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-21-n13"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-21-p0091" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In normal economic conditions, the potential drawbacks of relatively high or durable benefits on unemployment outflows and persistence can, in principle, be partly offset by their potentially positive effects on the quality, and therefore the duration, of job matches (see OECD, 2010a, for a discussion). </p></fnote> However, the design of unemployment benefits can also exert an influence on persistence by raising the wage threshold below which unemployed will turn down job offers (the so-called reservation wage), reducing job-search intensity and making wages less sensitive to unemployment.</p>

While higher unemployment benefits may raise persistence of unemployment by lowering the outflow rate, some of the measures should nonetheless stay in place, either temporarily or permanently. For instance, the extension of <emphasis emph="italic">coverage</emphasis> to additional categories of workers was implemented in response to the crisis but should in general be permanently kept for social reasons as well as to enhance the integration of certain groups in the labour market. Still, such extension needs to be coupled with conditionality and activation measures. Increases in benefit <emphasis emph="italic">duration</emphasis> also were a necessary temporary response in a number of countries to ensure adequate social protection and may also have helped to support aggregate demand. The high level of unemployment prevailing in some countries combined with the weak pace of the output recovery suggests that extended duration should be maintained for some time in order to provide added protection and to minimise the risk of labour force withdrawal and dependence on other forms of benefits.</p>

Indeed, many empirical studies – especially ones using micro data – have found that the average length of unemployment spells is significantly influenced by the duration of unemployment benefits. In any case, benefits should be conditional on job search and acceptance even from the early stages of the unemployment spells.

This is particularly the case for people with tenuous attachment to the labour market, be they related to health problems, lack of skills or other disadvantages. Most countries where disability rates trended up over time have taken action to stem the inflow into such income support programme, notably through tighter gate-keeping and better control of sickness certificates. However, bringing benefit recipients with considerable work capacity back to the job market has remained a common challenge. A recent review of country experiences (OECD, 2010d) suggests that policies should aim at strengthening financial incentives for beneficiaries to work and for employers to hire them, including through wage subsidies. In this regard, there is a case for better integrating disability benefits with other working-age benefits as part of a broader reform of the tax and benefit system to make work pay. In parallel, public employment services may need to be tailored to better suit the specific needs of those with partial work incapacity.</p>

This holds in particular in countries where the average caseload per staff providing public employment services is likely to have risen substantially during the crisis given the sharp increase in registered jobseekers. Between 2007 and 2009, the number of jobseekers has increased by at least 50% in the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the average caseload per staff has increased in most countries (OECD, 2010a).<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-26-n14"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-26-p0107" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Data on public employment service staff are not available for every country. Among those where it is, they indicate that the average caseload has increased by at least 50% in the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Turkey and United Kingdom. </p></fnote> In addition, since reducing the incidence of long-term unemployment is at this juncture crucial, the intensification of training programmes implemented in most countries in response to the crisis should in most cases be maintained, especially where the unemployment outflow rate has remained depressed. Even though the overall effectiveness of such programmes in providing a sustained exit from unemployment remains unclear, they may be worth pursuing in the current context of difficult access to job opportunities so as to help unemployed to preserve work ethics and limit skills erosion.</p>

However, it should also be recognised that such programmes involve relatively large fixed costs and capacity constraints. Therefore, their scale cannot be easily and quickly adapted and their budgetary cost can be substantial, clearly a constraint for many countries, not least those confronted with high risk of unemployment persistence. Moreover, they should be carefully designed to limit the public financing of training that firms would have financed anyway (so-called deadweight losses).</p>

For training the obvious candidates would be the low-skilled and long-term unemployed, especially in countries facing severe budget constraints. But there is also a case for involving workers early in unemployment spells if the nature of the economic shock renders job-specific skills obsolete immediately after job loss, for instance because structural adjustment away from a particular sector or activity is needed. For job-search assistance, focusing on cases that stand better chances to find a match would make sense given that the aim is to accelerate the return to work. But it could also generate sizeable waste to the extent that these workers may find a job even without assistance. Indeed, an opposite argument could be made for focusing efforts on the long-term unemployed, but this could also involve waste due to the higher risk of failure. In many countries, the most difficult cases to match are often addressed through jobs subsidies or direct public-sector job creation targeted at specific groups.</p>

Several countries have indeed implemented cuts in social security contributions or payroll taxes in response to the crisis. The advantage of such measures is that their impact can be fairly rapid and, in principle, they can be put in place on a temporary basis – though knowledge that they are temporary may reduce their effectiveness. However, the measures that are easier to implement, such as for instance cuts to non-wage costs of all existing jobs below a certain wage level, are also the least cost-effective in the short term (OECD, 2009).</p>

For this reason they are to be preferred over across-the-board cuts, not least in a context of fiscal consolidation. Targeting new hires that involve a net increase in jobs (so-called marginal job subsidies) constitutes in principle an even more effective policy, notably because it avoids <shortcitation>gaming</shortcitation> by firms through a mere increase in labour turnover. Indeed, a number of countries (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Turkey) have reduced social security contributions for new hires, in most cases with measures further targeted at specific groups, regions or firms. However, such marginal subsidies can be complex and lengthy to set up and difficult to monitor and administer. And, in the context of return to work strategies, the choice of instrument should also take into account the speed at which measures to stimulate labour demand can be effectively implemented.</p>

Based on recent empirical work, prime candidates among potential tax bases would be immovable property (see Arnold <emphasis emph="italic">et al.,</emphasis> 2011) or consumption, but environmental taxation could also be considered since it would help achieve other objectives at the same time. Even if they are reflected to some extent in the tax wedge, shifts towards environmental and consumption taxation would help employment insofar as they are levied on broader bases than taxes on wages.<fnote id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-32-n16"><p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-32-p0115" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Even though the consumption tax can be seen as part of the labour tax wedge, its broader base would imply that a revenue-neutral shift from income taxes and social contributions towards consumption taxation would still reduce the wedge.

Partly to minimise the impact on persistence, many countries (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) have set up so-called two-tier regimes of employment protection, with different and asymmetric degrees of restrictions on open-ended and fixed-term contracts.

This relatively good outcome can in part be attributed to earlier reforms along the lines advocated in the long-standing OECD strategy to boost employment and labour force participation. Even so, the experience over the past few years has clearly put to test many of the policy recommendations conveyed in the OECD strategy and brought a number of insights which could lead to their reassessment.</p>

Hence, the role of macro policies and conditions in supporting the on-going recovery remains determinant. While monetary policy is still accommodative, fiscal policy is constrained in many countries by the need to reduce large public-sector deficit and contain rising debt levels. This serves as a reminder of the need for macroeconomic policies during the good times to create room for manoeuvre during bad times.</p>

In this regard, the sharp contrast in the performance of older workers and youth may to some extent reflect the large difference in several countries in the degree of employment protection between the two groups. Also, pre-crisis reforms in pension systems, as well as the closing of early routes to retirement, have most likely contributed to the strong labour market participation of older workers during the recent episode. In any case, further analysis is required to better assess the relative contributions of the different possible explanations.</p>

              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-06-p0127" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In many countries, the reduction in average hours worked during the 2008-09 recession has limited the decline in employment given the observed drop in output. In part, hours adjustments rather than headcount adjustment have taken place due to work-sharing arrangements, partly operated <emphasis emph="italic">via</emphasis> public short-time work (STW) schemes. These programmes intend to preserve jobs in firms that experience temporarily low demand by encouraging job sharing, while also providing income support to workers who experience reductions in hours worked. As such, STW schemes are a form of job subsidy. These subsidies can be justified economically insofar as they may avoid losses of specific human capital in the wake of major but temporary economic shocks.</p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-06-p0128" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The effectiveness and cost-efficiency of STW schemes have been discussed at length in OECD (2010a) and Hijzen and Venn (2011). Although an empirical assessment of their long-term effects is not yet possible, STW schemes have helped preserve permanent jobs during the economic downturn while promoting reductions in average hours among permanent workers. In Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy and Japan, STW schemes are estimated to have substantially reduced the impact of the crisis on permanent employment. Hijzen and Venn (2011) estimate that about 234 000 and 416 000 jobs have been saved in Germany and Japan, respectively, thanks to these schemes.<boxnoteref refid="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs04-n01" format="boxnoteref"/></p>
              <p id="o12-C05-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-06-p0129" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">However, their contribution to preserve jobs differed substantially between countries that had already set up those schemes <emphasis emph="italic">before</emphasis> the crisis and those who introduced those schemes <emphasis emph="italic">during</emphasis> the crisis. This may indicate real difficulties in implementing an effective and timely STW scheme after a recession has begun, as the rate of layoffs tends to be higher in early phases of an economic downturn (OECD 2010a, Chapter 5). It also suggests that short-time work programmes could be set up and kept dormant in times of normal activity, and activated if necessary at the onset of future economic downturns.</p>

Firstly, <emphasis emph="italic">deadweight losses</emphasis> may be incurred if subsidies are paid for jobs that employers would have maintained even without public compensations. Secondly, <emphasis emph="italic">displacement effects</emphasis> may occur if STW schemes help preserve jobs that are not viable in the long run, entailing a sub-optimal allocation of capital and workers in the economy. Thirdly, STW could also act to accommodate unwarranted wage increases which might have an adverse influence on wage-setting. To avoid those risks, certain features in the design of STW schemes look desirable:</p>

First, it is an effective way of reducing deadweight losses. Second, it provides a built-in mechanism for encouraging firms to revert to statutory working hours as the pick-up in demand becomes clear. In practice, firms may either pay some fraction of the wage cost of hours not worked, or pay the full wage during an initial period. Of these two options, the former has an advantage in that it creates better incentives at the margin to withdraw from the scheme. In contrast, when firms pay up-front the full wage for a given period, they have less incentives to withdraw once the period is over. In any case, in several countries, such as Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Spain, firms do not bear any part of the cost.</p>

In practice, phasing out can be ensured by a regulatory maximum duration of STW schemes, which was on average equal to 14 months during the crisis (excluding Finland where there is no time limit). This duration limit was substantially increased in Austria, Germany and Switzerland in 2009. It is difficult to determine the optimal timing for scaling down STW programmes, but to avoid hysteresis effects in hours worked, it is important that working-time regulations return to normal within a reasonably short amount of time.</p>

The focus is on how policies can help to make the most of capital flows both by promoting global financial integration and limiting the associated risks, consistent with the G20 goal to promote strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth. Particular attention is given to the potential role of structural policies – broadly defined to include development of financial markets, general regulatory quality, as well as product market regulation that promotes competition and employment-friendly labour market policies – and how they could complement sound macroeconomic policies and ongoing financial, prudential and macro-prudential reforms which, although not investigated here, have key roles in reducing financial vulnerabilities (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C06-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs01"/>).

Growth-enhancing structural policy reform could help to narrow global imbalances by reducing net capital outflows from countries with large positive net foreign assets positions while also supporting their long-term growth. This is particularly the case in emerging countries where under-developed financial markets limit the ability of economies to absorb domestic and foreign capital, and in both emerging and advanced countries where domestic distortions lower risk-adjusted returns to capital.</p>

The most recent data (although sometimes only available to the third quarter of 2010) suggest that gross capital inflows seem to be back to, or above, their pre-crisis levels in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, where they already represent around 5% of GDP, and Chile and Turkey, where they have reached close to 8-9% of GDP. Such large inflows create a real macroeconomic challenge for these economies, given the associated risks of excessive currency appreciation, credit booms and busts and sudden stops.</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-03-p0006" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The analysis in this chapter suggests that structural reforms, in addition to promoting overall cross-borders flows, could help to reduce the associated vulnerabilities mainly <emphasis emph="italic">via</emphasis> a better composition of inflows, with more FDI and less debt. However, structural reforms generally take time to have their full effects and so may be seen as a complement to other policies which have a more immediate effect on large capital inflows and their consequences.</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-03-p0007" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the short term, macroeconomic policies have a key role to play. Letting the exchange rate appreciate and tightening fiscal policy could help moderate demand and related inflation pressures generated by the inflows, while making the inflows less attractive. Still these general principles have to be adapted to each specific country situation which in practice may mean the room for manoeuvre is limited: exchange rates may already be overvalued; or the fiscal stance may already be tight. The appropriate stance of monetary policy is a more complex issue as higher domestic interest may attract more inflows while a looser stance may fuel inflation pressures and asset prices bubbles. Several factors have therefore to be taken into account in the monetary policy response, including the extent of demand pressures and how they can be contained by exchange rates and fiscal policies, the risk of asset price and credit bubbles and the risks of de-anchoring inflation expectations. Regardless of the scope for using macroeconomic policies, there is likely to be a role for macro and micro-prudential policies, to generally limit excessive risk-taking, but also with the capacity to target particular sectors or asset classes, depending on the precise nature of the inflows and the associated risks.</p>

Also, reserve accumulation could be justified when the domestic currency is already largely overvalued, putting the export sector at strong risk.</p>

Appropriate macroeconomic policies, including allowing the exchange rate to appreciate or tightening fiscal policy, can help to reduce the magnitude of the credit cycle during an episode of large capital inflows. Growth-supportive structural policies, while attracting more net inflows, can modify their composition towards sources of financing that are usually seen as more stable and productive. More competition-friendly product market regulation, less stringent job protection, higher institutional quality and greater capital account openness are associated with a larger component of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and a smaller share of debt. Such a composition is likely to reduce the likelihood of credit booms as well as banking, currency and balance-of-payments crises.</p>

But reserve accumulation in some countries has reached levels far beyond average observed behaviour, related to motives of smooth trade financing and self insurance against outflows, and has become an important driver of capital flows from emerging to high-income countries. To the extent that excess reserve holding indicates mistrust in international financial safety nets, the improvement of these safety nets, which is already part of the G20 agenda, is essential.</p>

It provides a much more comprehensive coverage of capital account restrictions concerning direct investment, liquidation of direct investment, real estate, securities on capital markets, money markets, negotiable instruments and non-securitised claims, collective investment securities, credits directly linked with international commercial transactions or rendering of international services, financial credits and loans, sureties, guarantees and financial back-up facilities, deposit accounts, foreign exchange, life assurance, personal capital movements, physical movement of capital assets and disposal of non-resident-owned blocked funds. However, due to the so far limited country coverage it has not yet been exploited. With wider country coverage, the Code or a similar international instrument could thus serve as a yardstick to assess the degree of liberalisation achieved by each country in regard to capital movements.</p>

An adhering country enjoys the liberalisation measures of other adherents, regardless of its own degree of openness and OECD countries have unilaterally extended their measures to all members of the IMF. The Code provides flexibility to cope with situations of short-term capital volatility, including the introduction of controls on short-term capital operations and the re-imposition of controls on other operations in situations of severe balance-of-payments difficulties or financial disturbance. To avoid a beggar-thy-neighbour approach, or suspicion thereof, which could invite counter-measures, the Code provides an established process of international co-operation, managed and controlled through a forum, in which each country can explain its policies and raise questions about the policies of others.</p>

Those countries with large asset and liability positions in which banks played a large role were the most affected by the financial crisis. In the past two years, most countries and jurisdictions have undertaken initiatives to reform financial regulation and tackle the failures that led to the financial crisis. Such reforms are likely to have some impact on capital flows, which may not go back to pre-crisis levels, especially between advanced countries. In particular, higher liquidity requirements, tighter funding rules and regulations to limit leverage of banks and their foreign exchange exposure (resulting notably from Basel III) may constrain the recovery in cross-border bank flows.</p>

Over that period, rising outflows from emerging and developing economies were mainly driven by reserve accumulation and invested in advanced economies’ sovereign debt securities or close substitutes, with about one-fifth of the increase corresponding to higher outflows from oil-exporting countries. This increase in reserve accumulation reflects several factors, including exchange rate policies, self-insurance strategies by emerging markets partly due to some mistrust in the current system of financial safety nets (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs03"/>, and Mateos y Lago <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2009). Inflows to emerging and developing countries increased less than outflows and FDI remained the main overall source of international financing for these countries until 2007 when debt inflows became more important.</p>

              </heading>

By the end of 2010 the foreign exchange reserves of China alone totalled almost $3 trillion or around half of its annual GDP and accounted for almost one-third of total global foreign exchange reserves. After a temporary slowdown during the global economic downturn, reserve accumulation across the world continued apace through 2009 and 2010.</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0036" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">This rapid increase and high level of reserve holdings in some surplus countries has attracted considerable attention. Firstly, the build-up of reserves is closely associated with global imbalances and indeed, some have argued, contributed to the financial fragility that precipitated the recent global financial crisis. Secondly, the high opportunity cost of holding large stocks of low yielding assets is wasteful from a social welfare standpoint (Rodrik, 2006; Summers, 2006). And thirdly, with the US dollar being the pre-eminent global reserve currency, large holders are constrained in the choices they have regarding divestment, diversification and even the productive use of these assets, as such action could entail significant negative valuation effects (the so-called <shortcitation>dollar trap</shortcitation>).</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0037" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The reasons countries accumulate foreign exchange reserves fall into two broad categories. Firstly, reserves may be amassed as a direct consequence of export-led growth strategies and holding down the real value of the local currency. Reserves may also accumulate as a result of attempts to smooth short-term exchange-rate fluctuations. A second reason to hold foreign reserves is that they may provide a form of self-insurance against balance of payments crises, including sudden stops in access to external funding, or even just a means to smooth high-frequency volatility of flows. Traditionally, the focus was on adequately covering imports. In the late 1990s, following the Asian crisis, the focus shifted to covering a country’s stock of short-term debt (the so-called Guidotti-Greenspan rule). Then after the Argentine crisis, the scope of self-insurance broadened to include protecting local financial systems that are exposed to foreign market sentiment, capital flight by domestic agents and exchange rate movements. This evolution has implied a considerable escalation in the global demand for reserves.</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0038" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">There is a considerable literature that tries to explain the levels of foreign exchange reserves held across countries and their changes over time. However, this research is hampered by a number of factors including heterogeneity in reasons for accumulating reserves (for example, the intergenerational considerations of oil and other exporters of finite resources) and also the increasingly large role played by sovereign wealth funds (SWF). This literature falls into two broad categories. The first approach is to use calibrated behavioural models that rely on quantifying risk aversion, discount rates and other fundamental parameters (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Jeanne, 2007 and Jeanne and Rancière, 2008). These models generally conclude that current reserve holdings are well above optimal levels in the large accumulating countries. The second approach is to determine what factors account for reserve accumulation behaviour for a set of countries over time and then to make inferences about the behaviour of individual countries based on this (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Aizenman and Lee, 2007; Obstfeld <emphasis emph="italic">et al., </emphasis>2008; Cheung and Ito, 2009). This approach generally concludes that reserve levels in the large accumulating countries are in line with average behaviour given the particular characteristics of, and conditions in, these countries. However, the existing work that takes this second approach is somewhat outdated, and in light of the fact that reserve accumulation has accelerated over the past five years, so might be the conclusions.</p>
              <p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-13-p0039" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Recent OECD work has updated and extended the existing econometrics-approach literature using a panel of over 130 countries between 1980 and 2008 (see Vujanovic, 2011). The long-run determinates of a country’s reserve holdings are found to be trade openness and the size of the domestic financial sector (as proxied by M2), both of which may capture the self-insurance motives previously referred to. In addition to these factors, changes in GDP per capita, the exchange rate regime, exchange rate volatility and the degree of financial openness are associated with changes in the level of a country’s reserve holdings. This analysis suggests that the current ratio of reserves to GDP in the big accumulating countries is significantly above levels that are consistent with the average behaviour of all countries, even after taking into account developments in trade, financial deepening and other pertinent factors. Specifically, China and Japan record the largest deviations from the levels implied by the long-run cross-country determinants of reserves-to-GDP ratios, followed by South Korea, India and South Africa (see Figure below). Moreover, when expressed in dollar terms the  global  magnitude  of  these  deviations  stands  out  even  more;  on  average  over</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1070935" instlang="en" indent="n" numbering="y">the three years to 2008, the analysis suggests that China and Japan held reserves in excess of what corresponds to average behaviour of around $600 billion and $450 billion, respectively. Furthermore, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that in the case of China, where the accumulation of reserves accelerated after the end of 2008, the deviation from average behaviour eclipsed $1 trillion by 2009. In the case of Japan, large interventions in the foreign exchange market in 2003-04 dramatically pushed up the level of international reserves. So while the long-run level implied by average behaviour also climbed through to 2008 (on the back a surge in trade), a large (but declining) positive gap remains.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1070940" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">To the extent that the level of reserves does indeed exceed adequacy ratios in many countries, a greater proportion of these funds could be invested more diversely (and productively), thereby reducing the opportunity cost of holding reserves. This might include transferring a greater proportion of excess reserves to SWFs which typically invest more aggressively and in assets that are less liquid than do central banks (Jeanne, 2007). Indeed, recent moves in that direction by many countries add credence to the view that the current historically unprecedented levels of reserve holdings in some countries are excessive from the stand point of precaution or self-insurance. Diversification in the currencies in which reserves are held might also be prudent as an excessive concentration in one reserve currency could mean that the benefits of self-insurance might be offset by the risk of large capital losses in the event of a major realignment in exchange rates.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1070945" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">That having been said, there are good reasons that the US dollar is the preferred currency in which to hold foreign reserves. Firstly, reserves need to be in a currency that holds its value in a crisis. Secondly, the market for US dollars is both deep and liquid. Thirdly, to the extent that the stock of reserves serves as insurance against trade and debt shocks, if trade and debt are mostly denominated in US dollars, so therefore should be reserves. Furthermore, if the purpose is to defend a peg to a particular currency, then holding reserves in that counterpart currency would be preferable.</p>

Countries with more open financial markets, better institutional quality and more competitive product and labour markets tend to be more able to attract and absorb foreign and domestic capital as well as to export capital, and on balance have lower net foreign assets (Furceri <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2011a).

However, its use could be questioned on a number of grounds including the fact that it is inherently subjective and relies on data collected using a large variety of sources (for more details see Furceri and Mourougane, 2010). The various shortcomings notwithstanding, for the OECD countries the indicator is highly correlated with the OECD’s <shortcitation>product market regulation</shortcitation> indicator (with a correlation coefficient of 0.7).

Hence, while also supporting long-term growth, better regulatory quality, greater financial development and capital account openness and more flexible labour and product markets would contribute to a reduction of net asset positions of emerging economies in the long term. Getting there would involve a reduction in current account imbalances over a long period of time during which net foreign asset positions adjust to their new levels. The magnitude of the effects from structural policy changes is potentially large. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on necessarily uncertain regression results suggest that:<fnote id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-19-n05"><p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-19-p0053" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Such illustrative quantifications need to be interpreted with considerable caution given the difficulty to draw causal conclusions based on cross-country variation, the uncertainty around point estimates and the high collinearity between the indicators involved, which further suggests that summing the effect of changes in each indicator may substantially exaggerate the overall impact.</p></fnote></p>

If wider deficits are deemed undesirable they might have to be complemented by other measures to help increase net savings or at least limit their deterioration. In particular, reducing large fiscal deficits would have the double benefit of reducing risks associated with public debt sustainability and shrinking current account deficits.</p>

The risk of a misallocation of foreign capital is important, especially when financial markets in host countries are not well developed and not well regulated. But even well-developed and regulated systems are not spared. Countries with strong regulatory standards may also experience misallocation of foreign investment, as for example in Spain in the years before the crisis. Even in the well-developed US financial system, large inflows before the crisis may have been a factor behind a deterioration of lending standards.</p>

The costs of a financial crisis and exchange rate depreciation are also particularly high in countries with large foreign indebtedness (as depreciation may dramatically increase the cost of debt servicing and external financing dries up), and it may lead to a debt crisis.<fnote id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-07-n09"><p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-07-p0068" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A main exception being US legal entities that, thanks to the reserve status of the US dollar, borrow in their own currency, while holding a large share of their foreign assets in foreign currencies so that a depreciation of the dollar reduces US net external debt. </p></fnote></p>

The composition of inflows is also important in limiting risks and maximising benefits. For instance, the existence of non-linearities between capital account liberalisation and growth seems more important when inflows are mainly debt flows rather than FDI or equity investment (see Kose <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2009).</p></fnote> The analysis by Furceri<emphasis emph="italic"> et al. </emphasis>(2011c) also supports the view that structural policies can help to minimise the vulnerabilities generated by large inflows. For instance, capital account openness and greater financial liberalisation are associated with a lower probability of experiencing a banking crisis following large capital inflows (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-08-g005"/>). However, these relationships have to be interpreted with caution since they may also reflect some form of reverse causality, as countries that are less prone to crises may be more willing to liberalise and open their financial
system. In addition, since greater financial liberalisation and capital account openness may also increase the number and scale of episodes of large capital inflows, their total effect on the probability of banking crises remains uncertain.</p>

While it is associated with a higher share of FDI in inflows and a lower probability of banking crises, it is also associated with a higher probability of a sudden stop in capital inflows after a large inflow episode even when controlling for the size of inflows. This may reflect the role played by some forms of capital controls in skewing the composition of inflows towards longer maturity and in limiting subsequent outflows and capital flights. This was the case in Chile in the 1990s and it may have contributed together with structural reforms, some liberalisation of capital outflows and sound macroeconomic policies to the large inflows recorded in the first half of the decade not ending up in a crisis, in sharp contrast with the experience of the late 1970s-early 1980s. In any case, this suggests that more work is needed, notably on the implications of the different types of capital controls. </p></fnote> but also more pro-competition product market regulation and avoidance of overly stringent employment protection – are associated with a higher share of FDI and a lower share of debt (Furceri<emphasis emph="italic"> et al. </emphasis>2011a).<fnote id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-n12"><p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-p0075" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Some of these results are in line with findings in other studies, including previous OECD work. The finding that pro-competition regulations are associated with more FDI and less equity portfolio investment and debt
is common to Hajkova <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2006) and Nicoletti <emphasis emph="italic">et al. </emphasis>(2003). Less stringent EPL in host countries being associated with a higher share of FDI in liabilities is also in line with previous OECD findings and those of Javorcik and Spatareanu (2005). </p></fnote> Conversely, the probability of facing a crisis or a sudden stop after large inflow episodes is especially high when inflows are driven by debt (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-g006"/>).<fnote id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-n13"><p id="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-p0076" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Debt is defined as the sum of bond portfolio investments and other investments.</p></fnote> Moreover, debt-driven episodes of large capital inflows tend to have a stronger impact on domestic credit than when inflows are driven primarily through FDI or equity portfolio investment (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C06-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-09-g007"/>). Also FDI inflows are less volatile than debt and equity inflows and may be associated with lower risks of misallocation of capital compared with equity or debt inflows because they reduce asymmetries of information between foreigners and locals (see for instance Kirabaeva and Razin, 2010).</p>

On the one hand, improved structural policy settings are likely to increase the overall scale of capital flows which will increase risk. On the other hand, better structural policies (more competition-friendly product market regulation, less stringent job protection, higher institutional quality and greater capital account openness) are associated with a composition of capital inflows – principally more FDI and less debt – which is more stable and less prone to risk. The overall net effect on macroeconomic risk will depend on the particular form of structural reforms enacted, but also on how they are buttressed by progress in financial reforms to strengthen the prudential and macro-prudential framework in both emerging and advanced economies.</p>

But, as shown by Kuhn (1962), periods of continuity are occasionally interrupted by the discovery of anomalies, which lead to a new paradigm, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>a new way of perceiving and analysing the subject of study. Even though the <shortcitation>dismal science</shortcitation> has never seen universal agreement on a single paradigm, a succession of paradigms can still be distinguished in the history of economic policymaking. Each paradigm defines <shortcitation>not only the goals of economic policy and the kind of instruments that can be used to attain them, but also the very nature of the problems they are meant to be addressing</shortcitation> (Hall, 1993, pp. 279).</p>
        <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-p0002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> A prominent paradigm shift took place in the early 1980s when policies became more oriented towards the medium term and the supply side took centre stage in response to the stagflation of the 1970s. Since then there have been further developments in the paradigm, such as those associated with the rational expectations revolution which called for predictability and transparency of policymaking. The <shortcitation>Great Moderation</shortcitation> of stable growth and prices since the mid-1990s was seen as evidence of the paradigm’s success. However, favourable headline statistics masked growing underlying imbalances, and when these erupted with the financial crisis of 2008-09, established certainties again broke down and new approaches to policymaking came to the fore.</p>
        <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-p0003" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">This 50th Anniversary Special Chapter takes stock of the paradigm shifts in economic policymaking that have occurred since the Organisation began its work, both prior to the financial crisis and during it, drawing on the OECD’s key economic surveillance processes (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-bs01"/>). The chapter looks backward and forward. How have political and economic realities shaped the dominant paradigm? How has the financial crisis led the Organisation to reassess the pre-crisis paradigm? What parts of the pre-crisis paradigm appear to have failed and what parts may be worth preserving?</p>

These pull together expertise not only in the OECD’s Economics Department, but increasingly also in specialised Directorates and Committees of the OECD. For several years now there have been periodic <emphasis emph="italic">Surveys</emphasis> covering major non-member countries, such as the <shortcitation>BRICs</shortcitation>, Brazil, Russia, India, China, as well as Indonesia and South Africa. For a long time – most of the first three decades of the Organisation’s existence – the <emphasis emph="italic">Surveys</emphasis> centred on the shorter-term outlook for a country and the macroeconomic responses to the challenges posed by that outlook. But progressively structural policy issues (and their interaction with macroeconomic developments) gained prominence.</p>
            <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s01-p0005" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The Economic Policy Committee, a body of senior officials from finance/economics ministries and central banks, provides policy guidance on macroeconomic and structural issues. In this context, the <emphasis emph="italic">OECD</emphasis><emphasis emph="italic"> Economic Outlook</emphasis> analyses the economic situation and prospects – with an eye to long-run sustainability – and the policy requirements to which they give rise. The <emphasis emph="italic">OECD Economic Outlook</emphasis> first appeared six years after the Organisation started its activities, in 1967. The colophon in the first issue mentions that the <emphasis emph="italic">OECD Economic Outlook</emphasis> <shortcitation>… will appear initially twice a year, in July and December</shortcitation>. In fact it has remained a biannual publication, aside from a special issue in March 2009 to cover the exceptional circumstances at the height of the financial crisis in the winter of 2008-09. Since 2005 the annual <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> publication has provided an overview of key recommendations for structural reforms in individual countries, along with a checklist on how countries have responded to them. OECD policy analysis and advice also feeds into the G20, the single-most important global platform for the co-ordination of economic and financial policies since the onset of the crisis. </p>

While initially successful, they failed to cope with, first, large exchange rate misalignments in the early-1970s and, second, <shortcitation>stagflation</shortcitation> in the wake of the first and second oil price shocks.</p>
        <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-p0008" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the 1980s the focus of policies shifted to the medium term. Structural policies to liberalise product and labour markets took centre stage, and were embedded in a system of rules-based policymaking in the 1990s. This proved largely successful, although financial crises became more frequent and virulent. In the 2000s emerging market economies gradually – but surely – gained weight in the global economy. Imbalances increased amid regulatory and policy complacency, which eventually led to the recent financial crisis.</p>

Fiscal and monetary policy instruments were used to restore full employment, low inflation and external balances whenever developments diverged from these objectives. The paradigm appeared to work well. The 1960s were a period of rapid OECD growth (averaging over 5%, see <xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-g001"/> and <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="ZZZZOCDEid1010262"/>), stable inflation (3¾ per cent) and <shortcitation>full employment</shortcitation> – corresponding to OECD unemployment in the 3-3½ per cent range (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-g002"/> below).</p>

These pressures arose out of attempts to maintain fixed exchange rates at parities increasingly out of line with fundamentals in view of inflationary policies in the anchor country, the United States.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-p0011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Events in 1971 marked the end of this period. Pressure from international capital flows led to a series of policy actions, including exchange-rate realignments and periods of floating – most notably of the US dollar from August onwards after its gold convertibility had been abandoned. The so-called Smithsonian realignment in December 1971 brought little relief as exchange rate pressure continued and the Smithsonian parities broke down, with a generalised floating of exchange rates in early 1973. In 1979 the European Community launched the European Monetary System (EMS) of quasi-fixed exchange rates – the frontrunner of the single currency that was established in 1999.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-p0012" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the 1970s, inflation became a wide-spread problem – even before the oil shocks hit. Overriding importance was attached to avoiding any <shortcitation>unnecessary</shortcitation> cost in terms of marked increases in unemployment in the battle against inflation. This was held to be possible if demand stimulus could be supported by incomes policies containing wage growth, although views of the effectiveness of incomes policies differed and sometimes fluctuated sharply. But when the first oil shock following the Yom Kippur War in late 1973 sent oil prices to unprecedented heights (Figure 5 below), OECD output sharply fell in 1975 while inflation soared to some 14%.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-p0017" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the aftermath of the first oil shock policymakers were divided about how best to deal with a situation in which growth failed to recover to the pace desired while inflation remained stubbornly high (dubbed stagflation). One view was that, by careful management and the limiting of short-term growth ambitions it should be possible to achieve both satisfactory expansion and steady disinflation, as advocated by an OECD report prepared by eight leading economists (McCracken <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 1977). In a similar vein, the <emphasis emph="italic">OECD Economic Outlook</emphasis> No. 22 (OECD, 1977) noted that further expansionary policy action would be necessary while avoiding a very sharp pick-up of activity and an associated acceleration of inflation.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-p0018" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"><emphasis emph="italic">OECD Economic Outlook</emphasis> No. 22 also argued that countries in strong balance-of-payments positions should take up slack faster than countries in a weak position. This view was contested by a number of countries, typically those identified as <shortcitation>best placed</shortcitation> to expand, such as West Germany and Japan. Questions were also raised about whether it was possible to secure durable expansion through fiscal policy; whether there was a stable, long-term trade-off between inflation and unemployment; whether disinflation could be achieved without monetary rigour; whether income policies were realistic except in very specific periods and (smaller) countries; and whether the public sector should seek to reduce the share of national resources it absorbed.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-p0019" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">An uneasy consensus on a policy package was reached among the major seven (G7) countries at the Bonn Summit in 1978. Specifically, West Germany and Japan agreed to adopt fiscal stimulus measures in exchange for a commitment from the United States to raise its domestic oil price to world levels and the European commitment to reach a successful conclusion of the multilateral trade negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</p>

In many countries, in combination with increased economic rigidities, the shock led to sharp rises in rates of structural unemployment, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>consistent with achieving and maintaining low inflation.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-n01"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-01-p0021" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) for a seminal analysis of the interaction effect of adverse supply shocks and economic rigidities on unemployment in Europe.</p></fnote></p>

This period saw the launch of structural reforms to make OECD economies more efficient, flexible and competitive – although modestly at first and with the United States and United Kingdom leading the way and Australia, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand soon following suit.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-p0023" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> Monetary policy was geared to inflation control, for which limiting the growth of money supply initially was seen as crucial. Most OECD countries adopted or reinforced growth targets for monetary aggregates or – in Europe – continued to conduct their monetary policy so as to maintain exchange-rate parity between their currency and that of a country (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>Germany) that had been – and seemed likely to continue to be – successful in containing inflation. The result was an increase in real interest rates (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-03-g003"/>). Fiscal policy became medium-term oriented, seeking to reduce or eliminate deficits and to stabilise or bring down debt-to-GDP ratios. The United States was an important exception, at least initially, as the Reagan administration pursued tax cuts while substantially raising expenditures for its Strategic Defence Initiative (commonly known as <shortcitation>Star Wars</shortcitation>).</p>

This, together with the recovery of profits, the effects of financial market liberalisation and, in Europe, the prospect of the 1992 Single Market, underpinned a recovery of OECD economies. Employment increased at a pace not experienced on a durable basis for more than a decade, and the rate of unemployment followed a clear downward path (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-g002"/>).</p>

As well, in many cases monetary policy was directed for too long towards exchange rate targets that turned out to be unsustainable. As had been predicted by the Mundell-Fleming model, it became more challenging to manage exchange rates as capital accounts were opened.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-n02"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-02-p0026" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The Mundell-Fleming model, developed in the 1960s (Mundell, 1963, Fleming, 1962), predicted that if capital controls are removed a conflict between pegged exchange rates and monetary policy autonomy would result. </p></fnote> The monetary policy framework also had to be amended towards direct inflation targeting because of the widespread breakdown of the links between monetary aggregates and national income and prices.

However, after monetary policy was eased in response to the 1987 stock market crash, a financial and real estate bubble developed in Japan, which popped in the early 1990s. Similar developments were seen in the Nordic countries, as well as in the United States, culminating in the Savings and Loans and LTCM crises. Meanwhile, the analytical focus shifted to evaluating current account positions in the context of the balance between domestic saving and investment in each country.</p>

The <emphasis emph="italic">Jobs Study</emphasis> also reiterated the evident limits to the degree to which macroeconomic policy can be used to reduce unemployment. This was seen to require more emphasis on structural reforms, in particular greater wage flexibility, reductions in barriers to labour mobility and greater competition in product markets. Structural reform would also ease the speed limits to growth and reduce hysteresis effects.</p>

Other main OECD economies fared better. The US economy recovered smartly, with growth on average exceeding 3% per annum, led by surging productivity growth attributed to the impact of rapid progress in information and communication technologies. Growth in Europe met headwinds as countries pursued fiscal and monetary austerity to qualify for monetary union, but this also meant that inflation finally came under control and public finances improved. Perhaps even more importantly, product markets were liberalised and labour markets reformed, although at different speeds across countries.</p>

World trade soared and cross-border flows grew from around 5% of world GDP in the mid-1990s to about 20% in 2007 – the year preceding the global financial and economic crisis.

Coupled with an exchange-rate policy of pegging the currency to the US dollar and strict capital controls on capital outflows, this led to the build-up of over $3 trillion worth of foreign exchange reserves – almost 50% of GDP and one third of the global total. The bulk of China’s official reserves have been invested in US Treasury bonds, allowing the United States to finance its large current account deficit at favourable terms and to keep its bond yields low.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-04-n05"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s02-04-p0048" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">More generally, excess saving in external surplus countries thus was seen to explain the interest rate <shortcitation>conundrum</shortcitation> of persistently low bond yields in deficit countries such as the United States (Bernanke, 2005, Bernanke <emphasis emph="italic">et al.,</emphasis> 2011).</p></fnote></p>

Technological change allowed the development of new and ever more complex financial products. Weaknesses in supervision and regulation led to a neglect of the associated risks, especially when new products were hard to value properly and banks and corporations removed them from their balance sheet to so-called <shortcitation>special purpose vehicles</shortcitation>. Moreover, the mismatch between the generally longer maturity of portfolios and the short maturity of (abundant) money market loans risked leading to acute liquidity shortages if supply increases in money markets stalled.</p>

But this shock was again comfortably absorbed by a substantial easing of monetary policy, in part also in response to the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001. Housing and mortgage markets then took over from the stock market as a main attractor of liquidity in search for yield. In this context, real estate prices skyrocketed across a wide range of OECD countries, which produced large wealth effects on consumption and investment. Sustained growth ensued while inflation remained low. As risk appetites recovered and then reached new heights, prices in stock and bond markets also surged.</p>

A hallmark of this paradigm was a clear assignment of particular policy instruments to specific tasks (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="CHDDEIGF"/>). National macroeconomic policies, especially monetary policy, had become rules-based, forward-looking and stability-oriented, with the intention of becoming more predictable and helping to anchor expectations; structural policies were focused on improving longer-term growth prospects and the resilience to shocks.</p>

The main instrument used was the policy interest rate, accompanied by communication policies designed to ensure that policy actions became more predictable and better understood. Financial markets were viewed as efficient and forward-looking, allocating risks to those who could best bear them, so there would be no role for monetary policy to lean against asset price bubbles, even if these could be detected with any degree of confidence.</p>

Fiscal rules (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>the European Stability and Growth Pact) failed to provide incentives to encourage the build-up of a sufficient reserve in good times. The implications of rising private-sector imbalances for the sustainability of public finances were ignored and forecasts of underlying public budgets were too optimistic.

Policy decisions failed to incorporate the implications of the rapid pro-cyclical growth in financial leverage and risk-taking, the concentration of risk, and the increasing potential for the cross-border and cross-market transmission of economic and financial shocks. Efforts by the Bank of International Settlements to set up capital adequacy ratios in Basel I and then revising them in Basel II obscured the risks that were building up in banks’ balance sheets.</p>

Consumer and investment demand quickly started to fall in the United States. As the US financial crisis intensified, weakness spread globally. With wholesale money markets freezing up, companies started to liquidate inventories and in late 2008 world trade nose-dived. The sharpest contraction since the Great Depression of the 1930s unfolded.</p>

Massive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus was injected in most OECD and many non-OECD economies. As well, virtually all distressed systemically important financial institutions were rescued following the Lehman Brothers debacle, with central banks and governments providing ample liquidity and balance-sheet support. Many central banks resorted to non-conventional measures (large-scale intervention in capital markets so as to reduce the yields on longer maturities) alongside the provision of unlimited liquidity to the banking system.</p>
        <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-p0066" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">While substantial increases in unemployment and public deficits were recorded, dramatic effects at the scale of the Great Depression have thus far been avoided. One lesson to be drawn from this episode is that the Keynesian recipe of active demand management has been appropriate under conditions of extreme financial stress and a threat of the economy heading to a liquidity trap. However, new challenges have emerged for policymaking, chief among which are the complications that arise when the effectiveness of each strand of policy is heavily affected by the stance of other policies and the need to act under extreme uncertainty.</p>

In addition to lowering policy interest rates to close to the zero lower bound and implementing traditional fiscal stimulus measures, many countries opted to use non-conventional policy measures to stimulate aggregate demand and give support to impaired banking systems in a synchronised fashion. Substantial efforts were made to support financial institutions including the provision of credit, funding guarantees and liquidity to the financial system, bank recapitalisation using public funds, deposit guarantee extensions and efforts to move troubled assets from banks’ balance sheets to newly created asset management companies.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-01-p0068" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> Such actions blurred the traditional dividing lines between fiscal, monetary, financial and structural policy, making the effectiveness of separate policy instruments increasingly dependent on others. For example, fiscal support for the financial sector had important ramifications for the transmission of monetary policy. As well, some central banks made large purchases of public debt, often without explicit guarantees against potential losses, while purchases of other assets affected resource allocation, thus blurring the assignments of fiscal and monetary policies. Equally, low policy interest rates and non-standard monetary policies reduced the need for public recapitalisation and for the supervisory authorities to resolve impaired institutions. And structural policies were used to provide support to non-financial enterprises and limit the social and labour-market consequences of the recession even if such settings were not appropriate for the long run.</p>

Uncertainty about the output gap also matters for fiscal policy as a smaller output gap implies that a larger proportion of existing fiscal deficits are structural rather than cyclical.

When the crisis was acute uncertainty about the transmission of monetary stimulus was high as financial intermediation had become impaired. With policy rates near the zero bound, many central banks were forced to employ unconventional policy measures in order to support activity in capital markets and work round the impaired banking system, but there is limited knowledge about their effectiveness. With the exit from the crisis, monetary transmission has improved, but balance-sheet repair in the financial sector is far from complete and downside tail risks persist. This complicates the decisions about the timing of the exit from conventional and unconventional measures and their sequencing.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-02-n09"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-02-p0073" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Uncertainties also arise from difficulties in assessing the likely course of policy actions in other countries and the possible spill-overs from them.

During the acute phase of the crisis fiscal policy was faced with difficult choices about the scale and fiscal cost of the discretionary stimulus and the emergency actions to support the financial system. During the exit phase uncertainty remains, including in estimating the likely effects of consolidation on the economy. Although the short-term effects are likely to be negative, these effects can vary significantly according to the state of the economy as well as the choice of fiscal instrument.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-02-n10"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-02-p0075" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In principle, the short-term negative effect from consolidation could be smaller if policy interest rates can be lowered relative to earlier expectations and if the financial sector continues to recover as households are less credit constrained.

If credible, the consolidation may also exert a favourable impact on the sovereign risk premium and thereby stimulate demand and ease the fiscal consolidation effort (OECD, 2010a, b).</p></fnote></p>

The policy challenges are to eliminate slack in the economy, restore an appropriate inflation level and establish sound public finances and resilient financial markets. This process needs to take place in a large number of countries simultaneously; hence international co-operation, including through the G20, will be essential in the face of cross-country spill-over effects. Moreover, policy in one domain will need to take into account policy setting in others.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-03-p0077" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The challenge for <emphasis emph="italic">monetary policy</emphasis> will be to exit from exceptional stimulus without exacerbating fragilities in financial markets. In principle, and assuming inflation expectations stay anchored, the aim of monetary authorities should be to bring policy rates to their neutral levels by the time economic slack is eliminated. However, given the uncertainty about the output gap and potential discussed above, central banks may have to give more weight to survey measures of resource utilisation and inflation expectations and only move decisively towards neutral rates once these indicators suggest the economy is robustly on the mend. This strategy would by implication take into account the stance of fiscal policy as well as progress towards financial-sector repair to the extent they affect the outlook for inflation and activity.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-03-p0078" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">During the exit period, monetary policy will also have to keep an eye on macro-prudential risk to the extent new macro-prudential regulatory bodies are not yet fully operational. Abundant liquidity provision at near-zero funding costs allows banks to roll over the debt of non-viable businesses or intensify the search for yield, ultimately producing costly misallocation of resources or a build-up of financial fragilities (BIS, 2010). Thus, barring a relapse into recession or deflation, central banks should move policy interest rates to levels that, while still accommodative, are clearly above zero. Meanwhile, unconventional policy measures may remain in place for some more time and could indeed facilitate the normalisation of conventional policy.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-03-p0079" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">For <emphasis emph="italic">fiscal policy</emphasis>, exiting from crisis measures and restoring sound public finances is likely to continue well into the medium term. The pace of the exit should be commensurate with the state of public finances, the ease of sovereign funding, the strength of the recovery and the scope for monetary policy offsets. It should also take into account that delays in fiscal consolidation might increase interest rates and future growth. A credible fiscal consolidation will likely improve financial market conditions and hence the monetary transmission mechanism.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-03-p0080" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Furthermore, fiscal consolidations in which expenditure reductions have a high weight are more likely to result in durable retrenchment (Guichard <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2007) and more likely to be accommodated by monetary policy once it has departed from the zero-rate bound. Even so, tax increases look unavoidable in view of the size of the consolidation requirements. It is important that consolidation be growth-friendly. For example, raising the retirement age could bring long-term gains while having only limited effects on near-term growth. Priority should be given also to reducing the distortions created by subsidies and tax expenditures, and tax increases should be focused on the least distortive taxes such as on overall consumption and immovable property.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-03-p0081" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Since the onset of the crisis, attention has been given to identifying structural measures that could offer short-term support to aggregate demand as well as potential long-run benefits for economic growth and public budgets. However, sometimes there are tradeoffs between the two and a balance has to be struck. It is important to consider though that future benefits of growth-enhancing reform can have immediate positive effects as they allow monetary accommodation to continue for longer, bond yields to fall as the prospects of fiscal sustainability improve and private balance sheets to recover sooner. Structural reforms are especially urgent in labour markets to help countries make greater use of their available labour resources more quickly, to ensure that vulnerable groups remain attached to the labour market and to facilitate the reallocation of labour across sectors and regions.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s03-03-p0082" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Concerning the emerging market economies, monetary and fiscal stimulus injected during the global crisis should be withdrawn to damp rising inflation pressures and to prevent the development of bubbles in asset and real estate markets. They should not resist currency appreciation where a stronger exchange rate would be in line with the economic fundamentals and necessary to rebalance economic activity towards domestic absorption. Structural policies, including policies to shift activity from the informal to the formal sector of the economy and financial market reforms, should aim to enhance productivity and to achieve more inclusive growth.</p>

        <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-p0083" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> The repetition of financial crises since the early-1990s should have served as warnings that inadequate regulation and weak financial supervision can be risky in a globalised world economy and financial system. But policymakers took the overall benign economic development as evidence that the dominant paradigm worked and this eventually led to the 2008-09 financial crisis. In a globalised economy and financial system, financial vulnerabilities have increased. Booms and busts tend to be recurrent and so are the associated rescues of financial institutions and sovereigns. This, in turn, gives rise to concerns over moral hazard and the political acceptance – if not the legitimacy – of the policy paradigm.</p>
        <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-p0084" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Parts of the pre-crisis paradigm may remain valid after the crisis, including the orientation towards supply-side <shortcitation>structural</shortcitation> policies to achieve strong sustainable growth, the assignment of monetary policy to achieve price stability and the adoption of rules-based fiscal policy in the pursuit of sustainable public finances. However, in order to preserve and build on the wide-ranging benefits of globalisation, it is essential that the post-crisis paradigm be underpinned by safeguards to maintain financial stability and a strong commitment to sustainable, fair and <shortcitation>green</shortcitation> growth across the globe. All strands of economic policy – prudential, fiscal, structural and monetary – have a role to play, each within their remits and proper assignments. And all of them need to be co-ordinated internationally so as to achieve that policies reinforce, rather than work against, each other.</p>

The Basel Committee has defined new required minimum levels of bank capital (and the transition period for achieving these standards).<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-01-n11"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-01-p0086" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See BCBS (2010).

Moreover, ending the netting of derivatives positions in financial statements or more generally the possibility of keeping risks off-balance would help to better reveal the exposure to counterparty risk. It will also be important to deal with incentives problems embedded in remuneration systems and moral hazard for financial institutions that are too big or interconnected to fail.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-01-n13"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-01-p0088" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Such institutions have an incentive to take excessive rise and benefit from a competitive edge in terms of funding costs and the collateral they can accept because of their <emphasis emph="italic">de facto</emphasis> government backstop. This problem can be addressed by breaking up systemically important institutions, although this is challenging politically, or by imposing higher capital requirements. </p></fnote> Finally, to avoid banks shifting risks to non-bank financial institutions, financial reform should encompass pension funds, insurance companies and various types of investment funds.</p>

To ensure the stability of the financial system, macro-prudential policy instruments need to be developed to guard against the pro-cyclical build-up of financial imbalances in the economy (OECD, 2010a; Lawson <emphasis emph="italic">et al.,</emphasis> 2009). Specific tools that could be employed include contingent add-ons to the micro-prudential buffers as a function of aggregate borrowers’ leverage, and procedures for orderly resolution of cross-border financial institutions. Higher margin requirements, including limits to loan-to-value ratios in mortgage lending, could also be envisaged. In addition, stress tests of banks need to become more systemic, regular and harmonised across jurisdictions, and their results publicly available.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-01-n14"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-01-p0090" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">There are implementation difficulties in adopting such measures, including the choice of indicators to consider when setting these policy instruments. Another issue is whether policy measures should obey a simple rule, or whether more discretion should be allowed for (Yellen, 2010). It will also be important that macro-prudential bodies have a clear mandate and are accountable for it.</p></fnote></p>

Before the crisis the dominant view was in favour of cleaning but not leaning, pointing to difficulties of indentifying bubbles in real time and concerns that leaning could un-anchor inflation expectations even if it was widely acknowledged that cleaning but not leaning might produce moral hazard and encourage excessive risk taking. However, the severity of the crisis has strengthened the case of those who argue for leaning against asset price bubbles, especially if these are accompanied by rapid credit growth.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n15"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0092" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See Blinder (2010a) and Stark (2010).</p></fnote> At the very least, monetary policy should guard against an unnecessarily lax policy stance fuelling asset price misalignments.</p>

Doing so risks blurring the assignment of policy instruments to targets, thus complicating the communication and accountability of monetary policy. If bubbles can be identified, macro-prudential regulation and supervision (see above) offer better targeted tools to prevent them. Nonetheless, it might be argued that it is necessary for central banks to adopt a sufficiently long horizon over which to achieve price stability – and this would imply a concomitant need to incorporate financial stability considerations in their policy decisions. To date only the European Central Bank has formally incorporated financial variables in its framework, although it is unclear to what extent this has effectively driven its monetary policy decisions.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n16"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0094" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The monetary pillar of the ECB's policy framework has been discussed extensively in the academic literature, see <emphasis emph="italic">inter alia</emphasis> Svensson (2010a, b), Gerlach and Svensson (2003), Gerlach (2004), Beck and Wieland (2007) and Berger <emphasis emph="italic">et al. </emphasis>(2010).

It would provide room for monetary policy to react to large adverse shocks with less risk of hitting the zero-rate bound.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n17"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0096" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See Williams (2009) and Blanchard <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis> (2010).</p></fnote> It might also enhance wage flexibility and hence facilitate the absorption of large adverse shocks.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n18"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0097" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See Summers (1991). It would also produce a one-time reduction in the real value of sovereign debt, but this advantage may well be offset by higher risk premiums on sovereign debt yields in the future.</p></fnote> However, there are also drawbacks attached to such a move, not least that central banks might lose some of their hard-won credibility.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n19"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0098" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">See Bean <emphasis emph="italic">et al. </emphasis>(2010). Other drawbacks are that even small increases in trend inflation may compound distortions in the tax system (Feldstein, 1999), and that inflation above 2% could hardly be regarded as price stability as quality adjustments are increasingly incorporated in price estimates. </p></fnote> A related suggestion is that monetary policy could target the price <emphasis emph="italic">level</emphasis> rather than the inflation rate, notably at times of financial distress. In theory this could provide a stabilising mechanism as inflation expectations automatically increase (and hence real interest rates fall) if the price level was below target in a slump. But price-level targeting would be dangerous in the face of one-time hikes in indirect taxes or in commodity prices
as the ensuing increase in real interest rates would exacerbate the shock.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n20"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0099" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">For the automatic stabilisation argument of price level targeting, see Eggertson and Woodford (2003), Ambler (2009) and Cournède and Moccero (2009). This mechanism would fail though if inflation expectations are adaptive rather forward looking (Murray, 2010). There are also many practical implementation and communication problems (Goodhart, 2005; Edey, 2008; Bean <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2010), including the timing of the switch from inflation to price-level targeting (and back).</p></fnote> At any rate, no OECD country pursues a price-level target.</p>

Moreover, central bank interventions in private debt markets could create distortions. Quantitative easing also exposes the central banks balance sheet to market risk, including risks associated with sovereign bonds. The upshot is that in normal times, central banks should not aim to influence the shape of the yield curve other than through communication or conventional sterilised open market purchases of longer-dated securities. As well, impediments in monetary transmission due to distressed banks or solvency concerns about sovereign debt would best be tackled by addressing these problems at source.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0102" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Finally, an open question is to what extent macro-prudential and monetary policies need to be co-ordinated since macro-prudential policies will affect the monetary transmission mechanism (especially through the credit channel). Combining both types of policy in a single institution could facilitate such co-ordination, but having separate authorities – each with its area of responsibility and instruments – would offer greater accountability. If the latter set-up were to emerge as the preferred one, an explicit co-ordination mechanism between the two institutions would be needed to indentify the build-up of systemic risks and decide the best response to them.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-n22"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-02-p0103" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In practice, both types of policy are likely to respond to aggregate demand shocks in a similar manner (easing), but this may not be the case for aggregate supply shocks. Moreover, as noted, if macro-prudential policies are underdeveloped, monetary policy may need to lean against the wind of the asset cycle (White, 2009). As well, if policy interest rates are at the zero bound, macro-prudential policies might have to place greater weight on their macroeconomic effects than would otherwise be the case (Yellen, 2010).</p></fnote> There is a related issue about where responsibility for micro-prudential supervision would lie. Central banks are the lenders of last resort but in normal times should not be involved in the rescue of impaired financial institutions, which is the responsibility of the fiscal authorities. In the event of the failure of cross-border institutions, arrangements will need to be in place between governments for burden sharing.</p>

In the run-up to the financial crisis the asset-adjusted deficit (as a share of GDP) was between 1½ and 2 percentage points higher than the tradition measure in several OECD countries. </p></fnote></p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-03-p0106" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y"> A change in the fiscal policy framework, including well-designed fiscal rules, can assist fiscal policy to become more sustainable, transparent, predictable and counter-cyclical. In particular, medium-term expenditure rules, incorporating expenditure plans or ceilings to complement deficit or debt ceilings, offer a way of limiting boom-bust spending cycles and ensuring that unexpected revenues are saved rather than spent. Expenditure rules can help to build up reserves in cyclical upswings, to create room for the unfettered working of automatic fiscal stabilisers, and possibly discretionary stimulus, in a downturn.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-03-n24"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-03-p0107" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A general problem with fiscal rules, namely that they can encourage <shortcitation>gimmickry</shortcitation> such as one-off measures and creative accounting to circumvent them (Koen and Van den Noord, 2005), might be even more serious with an ambitious expenditure rule since this will bite more often (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e.</emphasis> not only mostly in bad times but even also in good times) than a deficit rule. Part of the solution is to ensure the expenditure rule has a wide ambit to include all outlays (Price, 2010), applies to different levels of government and includes the monitoring of tax expenditures (Anderson and Minarik, 2006). A related risk with strict fiscal rules is that they may induce regulations to attain outcomes previously obtained by fiscal instruments.</p></fnote> Within this framework, decisions on individual spending categories should be made in line with efficiency considerations and other government objectives.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-03-p0108" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Fiscal rules need to be sufficiently binding in normal times and sufficiently flexible in exceptional times to be credible and effective. Establishing an independent fiscal council can be an important means of strengthening compliance with the fiscal rules, by raising the political cost of deviating from them. To be effective, a council needs to have an important role in the budget process, although government should keep the final fiscal responsibility. A key potential role for an independent council would be to advance independent and authoritative views in the pursuit of transparency of fiscal decision making. It must be supported by fully independent statistical agencies and auditing offices that record outlays and revenues using appropriate accounting principles.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-03-p0109" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In monetary unions, which share a single currency and monetary policy while maintaining separate national fiscal policies, an instrument to deal with sovereign debt stress needs to be in place. As well, fiscal governance can be strengthened through more intense market discipline by allowing for the possibility of orderly debt restructuring. If markets anticipate that countries with unsustainable fiscal positions would not be bailed out and private-sector losses would have to be incurred, they may price sovereign risk properly. To limit the risk of financial contagion, financial regulations should take into account the possibility of sovereign default in terms of capital requirements, haircuts on collateral for central bank operations and requiring appropriate diversification of risk. This also calls into question whether the zero-risk weighting given to sovereign debt under the Basel II and III frameworks is appropriate. </p>

As discussed in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>, structural policies should aim to facilitate a swift return to work so as to minimise this risk. Labour markets have done comparatively well in view of the magnitude of the recession, which can in part be attributed to earlier reforms. But the experience of crisis has yielded a number of new insights, including that temporary extensions of the duration of unemployment benefits and work sharing arrangements at times of distress can be effective, and that partial reform strategies that produce <shortcitation>dual labour markets</shortcitation>, leaving some groups particularly vulnerable in bad times, are potentially damaging.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-04-p0111" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">There are several ways in which growth-enhancing structural reforms can also contribute to fiscal consolidation. For example, increasing the retirement age can boost labour utilisation and demand while at the same time mitigating the budget pressures resulting from ageing societies. Furthermore, moving to best practices in the provision of health care and education can create room for consolidation without compromising service levels. Reforms that boost private-sector employment raise tax revenues; reforms can also reduce unemployment benefits and lower the public-sector wage bill relative to GDP.<fnote id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-04-n25"><p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-04-p0112" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Calculations in OECD (2010b) suggest that a 1 percentage point improvement in the employment rate improve government balances by between 0.3-0.8% of GDP.</p></fnote> Product‑market reforms that enhance productivity also have the potential to raise tax revenues, although they also tend to spill over in higher public-sector wages and transfers, thus offsetting some of this favourable fiscal effect.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-04-p0113" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Reforms to ease rigidities in labour and product markets remain needed to make economies more resilient to adverse shocks, either by damping their impact or by making their impact less persistent. In particular, reforms that remove gaps in employment protection between groups of workers, ensure sufficient flexibility in wage bargaining and weaken anti-competitive product-market regulations, could all enhance resilience, although potentially at the cost of a deeper initial impact from shocks. The implementation of micro and macro-prudential reforms could also help to improve resilience by securing the transmission of monetary policy and ensuring that financial intermediation continues to function even at times of crisis.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-04-p0114" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Finally, structural reforms have a key role in addressing the underlying determinants of global imbalances through their impact on consumption, saving and investment (OECD, 2011). Developing social welfare systems in China and other Asian economies would fulfil important social goals, and as a side‑effect would reduce the need for precautionary saving, thus curbing the large current account surpluses of some of these countries. Product market reforms in services industries could encourage capital spending and thereby reduce current account surpluses in countries such as Japan and Germany. Removal of policy distortions that encourage consumption, such as tax deductibility of interest payments on mortgages, could help increase household saving and reduce the current account deficit in a number of countries, not least the United States. Financial market reforms could relax borrowing constraints in emerging economies and thereby boost consumption and investment and curb their current account surpluses, but should be accompanied by appropriate prudential controls.</p>

This will require international co-operation, surveillance and communication in setting priorities and in minimising any potential adverse side-effects that can arise from the resulting geographical constellation of policies. One aspect of this is the international effort underway to strengthen prudential frameworks around the world. Beyond this, the role of the G20 <emphasis emph="italic">Framework for Strong Sustainable and Balanced Growth</emphasis> is to identify a combination of macroeconomic, structural and exchange-rate policies that would strengthen growth prospects and helps to achieve more sustainable fiscal positions whilst minimising the risks of renewed widening in global imbalances.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-05-p0116" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Co-operation is also necessary if the international monetary system is to be strengthened. Eventually, real exchange rates will move in line with policy differences as well as different growth rates, inflation and fiscal positions. Specifically, over time it would be expected that emerging market economies would experience a real appreciation. If the nominal exchange rate is fixed, the required changes have to come through adjustments to wages and prices, which can be costly as it would risk de-anchoring inflation expectations. Persistent currency misalignments in the interim can generate unsustainable external imbalances. Hence reforms are needed to facilitate the movement of exchange rates in line with economic fundamentals so as to ensure that nominal exchange-rate adjustment acts as a safety valve. On the other hand, excessive exchange-rate volatility can also have its costs.</p>
          <p id="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01-s04-05-p0117" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A factor to take into account is that large capital flows to emerging market economies in search for yield risk producing <shortcitation>Dutch disease</shortcitation>, reckless risk-taking and sudden stops or reversals. To smoothly channel and absorb capital inflows, emerging market economies should aim to have the appropriate mix of macroeconomic policies in place (move towards sustainable fiscal policy where this is not yet the case and not resist appreciation of their exchange rate) and strengthen macro-prudential frameworks to further contain the risk of financial instability. Capital restrictions should be a last resort and undertaken in a transparent manner and subject to international discussion. A framework for common principles underlying capital account policies could facilitate and enhance stability while guaranteeing open capital markets. Finally, the OECD has identified a possible role for structural policies to attenuate the financial stability risks associated with capital inflows – by influencing their composition towards more stable and productive forms of financing such as foreign direct investment (see <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="Chapter" refid="o12-C07-2011-01-1-P00-c01"/>).</p>
