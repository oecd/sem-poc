	The Policy Imperative: Rebuild Confidence</mainhead>
      </heading>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0001" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The global economy has deteriorated significantly since our previous <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>. Advanced economies are slowing down and the euro area appears to be in a mild recession. Concerns about sovereign debt sustainability in the European monetary union are becoming increasingly widespread. Recent contagion to countries thought to have relatively solid public finances could massively escalate economic disruption if not addressed. Unemployment remains very high in many OECD economies and, ominously, long-term unemployment is becoming increasingly common. Emerging economies are still growing at a healthy pace, but their growth rates are also moderating. In these countries falls in commodity prices and the slower global growth have started to mitigate inflationary pressures. More recently, international trade growth has weakened significantly. Contrary to what was expected earlier this year, the global economy is not out of the woods. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0002" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Many factors underpin this assessment. The headwinds of deleveraging in the financial and government sectors remain with us. Likewise, imbalances within the euro area, which reflect deep-seated fiscal, financial and structural problems, have not been adequately resolved. Above all, confidence has dropped sharply as scepticism has grown that euro area policy makers can deal effectively with the key challenges they face. Serious downside risks remain in the euro area, linked to the possibility of a sovereign default and its cross-border effects on creditors, and loss of confidence in sovereign debt markets and the monetary union itself. Another serious downside risk is that no action will be agreed upon to counter the pre-programmed fiscal tightening in the United States, which could tip the economy into a recession that monetary policy can do little to counter.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0003" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">More than usual, world economic prospects depend on events, the nature and timing of which are highly uncertain. The projections presented in this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> portray a scenario that rests on the assumptions that monetary policy remains very supportive (and, in some places, becomes more so), that sovereign debt and banking sector problems in the euro area are contained and that excessive fiscal tightening will be avoided. From the second half of 2012, confidence is assumed to recover gradually as it becomes clearer that worst-case outcomes have been avoided. Near-term output growth is subdued in the OECD economies and at below-trend rates in the major emerging-market economies, developments which are likely to be associated with further short-term weakening of sentiment and confidence. In some economies, especially the euro area, a mild recession is projected in the near term. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0004" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Alternative scenarios are possible, and may be even more likely than the baseline. A downside scenario would be characterised by materialisation of negative risks and the absence of adequate policy action to deal with them. An upside scenario could arise if policy action were successful in boosting confidence and no significant negative events occurred. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0005" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the downside scenario, the implications of a major negative event in the euro area will depend on the channels at work and their virulence. The results could range from relatively benign to highly devastating outcomes. A large negative event would, however, most likely send the OECD area as a whole into recession, with marked declines in activity in the United States and Japan, and prolong and deepen the recession in the euro area. Unemployment would rise still further. The emerging market economies would not be immune, with global trade volumes falling strongly, and the value of their international asset holdings being hit by weaker financial asset prices. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0006" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">What would be required for an upside scenario to materialise? A credible commitment by euro area governments that contagion would be blocked, backed by clearly adequate resources. To eliminate contagion risks, banks will have to be well capitalised. Decisive policies and the appropriate institutional responses will have to be put in place to ensure smooth financing at reasonable interest rates for sovereigns. This calls for rapid, credible and substantial increases in the capacity of the EFSF together with, or including, greater use of the ECB balance sheet. Such forceful policy action, complemented by appropriate governance reform to offset moral hazard, could result in a significant boost to growth in the euro area and the global economy.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0007" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">An upside scenario also requires substantial and credible commitment at the country level, in both advanced and emerging market economies, to pursue a sustainable structural adjustment to raise long-term growth rates and promote global rebalancing. In Europe, such policies are also needed to make progress in resolving the underlying structural imbalances that lie at the heart of the euro area crisis. Deep structural reforms will be instrumental in strengthening the adjustment mechanisms in labour and product markets that, together with a robust repair of the financial system, are essential for the good functioning of the monetary union. By raising confidence, lowering uncertainty and removing impediments to economic activity, rapid implementation of such reforms could raise consumption, investment and employment. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0008" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">If combined, stronger macroeconomic and structural policies might raise OECD output growth by as early as 2013. The largest benefits would be felt in the euro area, though these could take some time to emerge. Stronger activity and trade, and the consequent rise in asset values in the OECD economies, should boost activity in the emerging market economies as well. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0009" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In view of the great uncertainty policy makers now confront, they must be prepared to face the worst. The OECD Strategic Response identifies country-specific policy actions that need to be implemented if the downside scenario materialises: the financial sector must be stabilised and the social safety net protected; further monetary policy easing should be undertaken; and fiscal support should be provided where this is practical. At the same time, stronger fiscal frameworks should be adopted to reassure markets that the public finances can be brought under control.</p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0010" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Beyond this, a wide range of structural measures, which are desirable in their own right, will become urgent. While priorities vary from country to country, such policies include the removal of barriers in product and labour markets that inhibit economic activity and employment. Appropriate labour market policies are needed to deal with the consequences of unemployment which is turning from cyclical to structural, thereby sapping potential growth, hitting confidence and undermining public finances. </p>
      <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s01-p0011" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The difference between the upside and the downside scenarios reflects the impact of credible, confidence building policy action. Such action, as we have seen, requires measures to be implemented at the euro area level as well as at the country level throughout the OECD, especially in the structural policy domain. In the case of a downside scenario, policy action would clearly be needed to avoid the worst outcomes. But then the question arises of why policy efforts are not taken to deliver the upside scenario even if the worst case does not materialise. Why, in other words, should we settle for less?</p>

The economic outlook is now more uncertain than usual, with a number of possible events related to the euro area debt crisis and fiscal policy in the United States likely to dominate economic developments in the coming two years. With the nature and timing of such events impossible to predict, a <shortcitation>muddling-through</shortcitation> projection is presented here, in which disorderly sovereign defaults, systemic bank failures and excessive fiscal tightening are assumed to be avoided. The risks around this projection emerge largely from OECD economies and are tilted to the downside.</p>

On this basis, unemployment would remain very high while inflation would drift down, though deflation would be avoided provided inflation expectations do not become unanchored. In emerging market economies, inflation is projected to ease as pressures on resources dissipate, with growth staying soft in the near term. The outlook would be much darker if negative events were to occur, notably those that could lead to an intensification of concerns about the robustness of the banking system and contagion in euro-area sovereign debt markets, or an excessively tight fiscal policy in the United States due to political gridlock. On the other hand, prospects for the global and OECD economy could become significantly brighter if measures were taken to successfully stem pressures in the euro area and a credible medium-term fiscal programme was to be enacted in the United States.</p>

After briefly reviewing the main forces at work, it sets out the muddling-through projection and policy requirements consistent with such an outlook. It then turns to the consequences of alternative scenarios in the euro area, assessing the strength of the different contagion channels and the resources and policies required to stem contagion. An alternative fiscal scenario in the United States is then presented, based on different assumptions about the future stance of fiscal policy. Finally, the chapter sets out key macroeconomic policy requirements and structural reform measures that would become more urgent should activity turn out to be significantly weaker than projected.</p>

Emerging market output growth has also continued to soften, reflecting the impact of past domestic monetary policy tightening, sluggish external demand and high inflation. Against this background, the protracted fiscal-policy discussions in the United States and the deepening euro area crisis have highlighted the role of destabilising events and policies as well as the reduced political and economic scope for macroeconomic policies to cushion economies against further adverse shocks. In turn, this has heightened risk awareness and uncertainty, with a corresponding drop in confidence, both in financial markets and in the non-financial private sector. Lower confidence will weigh on the global economy in the coming quarters. Key forces acting include:</p>

Widespread flooding in Thailand has also begun to generate renewed disruptions in global supply chains, which will further damp trade growth temporarily. The softening in global demand has begun to be reflected in global commodity prices, but only to a relatively limited extent to date, especially in oil markets. This may reflect expectations of continued relatively strong growth in comparatively commodity-intensive emerging market economies. Even so, the easing of commodity prices that has already occurred should provide a modest fillip to the OECD economies (whose growth might otherwise have been even weaker) by up to ¼ percentage point per annum, over the next two years. It will also act to further ease recent pressures on headline inflation.</p>

In the United States, equity prices have declined by around 8¼ per cent since the end of the first quarter, reducing the value of household financial assets by around $1.6 trillion, taking into account the impact on the value of equities held directly by households and indirectly through pension funds and mutual funds. Assuming a marginal propensity to consume out of financial wealth of 6 cents per dollar (Carroll <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2011), this implies an eventual reduction in household consumption of around 0.9%. The equivalent calculations for the euro area, where equity prices have declined by close to 25% since the end of the first quarter, imply a reduction in household consumption of 0.8%. The wealth calculations for the euro area take account of quoted equities, unquoted equities and mutual funds held directly by households and indirectly through insurance and pension funds. Equity price changes are assumed to apply to 40% of unquoted equity holdings and 30% of mutual fund holdings.</p></fnote> This is likely to contribute to keeping household saving rates elevated for some time to come, to help repair balance sheets. In addition, reflecting the widespread slack remaining in labour markets and the upturn in headline inflation this year, real wage and household income growth remains modest, holding back household consumption
growth. Over and above effects from balance sheets and real income, the large recent declines in consumer confidence could also damp consumption growth in the near term (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-bs01"/>).</p>

Such changes are often taken as an early, and timely, indicator of short-term cyclical swings in activity. This is especially so for hard and costly to reverse decisions, such as fixed investment, new hiring and purchase of durable goods. For such decisions, heightened uncertainty raises the option value of waiting, and hence weakens near-term expenditure (Bernanke, 1983; Pindyck, 1991; Bloom, 2009 and 2011). Equally, movements in survey-based indicators of consumer confidence have also been found to have a direct significant association with current and future private consumption growth (Nahuis and Jansen, 2004), particularly if the movements are large (Dees and Brinca, 2011), even if other factors such as income and wealth are taken into account (Carroll <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 1994; Ludvigson, 2004; Wilcox, 2007).</p>

To assess these, the OECD has developed simple quarterly indicator-type models for consumption growth and business investment growth in the United States and the euro area (see Jin <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2011). These quarterly equations are augmented by separate monthly models for business and consumer confidence.</p>

In both economies, the projected outcome from these equations is somewhat weaker than in the muddling-through projection. This is particularly so in the euro area, where quarterly declines are projected by the indicator equation until the latter half of 2012; in contrast, the muddling-through projection is for weak, but positive investment growth from the second quarter of 2012.</p>

In particular, balance sheets are already adjusting at a sustained pace, which may limit the need for a further large precautionary upward adjustment in private sector saving rates in response to weaker asset prices. Many companies also have large cash holdings, which could be used as a buffer to help support employment and investment if sluggish growth is expected to be only short lived. Survey indicators also suggest that inventories have not yet risen to the excessive levels attained in 2008-09, reducing the likelihood that weakness in final demand will be reinforced by a large contraction in inventory levels. Similarly, other cyclically-sensitive categories of expenditure, notably housing investment and consumer durables, now account for a much lower share of final expenditure than in 2006-07.</p>

Against this backdrop, near-term output growth is projected to be subdued in the OECD economies and at below-trend rates in the major emerging market economies. In some economies, especially the euro area, a mild recession is projected in the near term. Ongoing support is provided by accommodative monetary policies throughout the projection period (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-bs02"/>), but continued fiscal consolidation and weak labour, housing and credit markets will all act to check growth. Further ahead, from the latter half of 2012, the recovery is thus likely to be only modest, reflecting the gradual speed and extent to which confidence is assumed to recover as it becomes clear that other, worst-case, scenarios have been avoided. The key features of the economic outlook for the major economies are as follows:</p>

Where government plans for 2012-13 have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. Otherwise, in countries with impaired public finances, a tightening of the underlying primary balance of about ½ and 1% of GDP in 2012 and 2013, respectively, has been built into the projections. Where there is insufficient information to determine the allocation of budget cuts, the presumption is that they apply equally to the spending and revenue side, and are spread proportionally across components. These conventions allow for needed consolidation in countries where plans have not been announced at a sufficiently detailed level to be incorporated in the projections. Along this line, the following assumptions were adopted (with additional adjustments if OECD and government projections for economic activity differ):</p>

Given the legislative uncertainty about budget policy for 2012 and 2013, the general government underlying primary balance is assumed to improve by ½ and 1 per cent of GDP in 2012 and 2013, respectively.</p>

The projection also includes reconstruction spending of around 19 trillion yen (about 4% of GDP) over five years and the planned tax increases of around 11 trillion yen (about 2% of GDP) over a period of up to 25 years to finance such spending.</p>

For France, the projections incorporate the government’s medium-term consolidation programme, including recently announced measures aimed at compensating for weaker growth. For Italy the projections incorporate legislation up to and including the September Emergency Budget, and additional tightening needed to respect the government’s commitment to a near-zero deficit in 2013 given that projected activity is lower than that on which the budget legislation is based. For the United Kingdom, the projections are based on tax measures and spending paths set in the March 2011 budget.</p>

For the purpose of making the analysis in the <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> independent from strong temporary fluctuations in government debt levels on account of valuation effects, for these countries, the change in 2010 in government debt has been approximated by the change in government liabilities recorded for the Maastricht definition of general government debt.

Weak confidence, soft employment growth and the renewed pressures on balance sheets from lower asset values are all likely to damp consumers’ expenditure. Heightened uncertainty should also moderate business investment growth in the near term, despite healthy corporate balance sheets. Continued fiscal consolidation, although assumed to be at a more moderate pace than in 2011, will also hold back activity. Provided confidence recovers during 2012, as assumed, accommodative monetary policy and strengthening external demand should help to buoy activity through 2013, allowing the sizable negative output gap to narrow marginally. But, despite a pick-up in employment growth, the unemployment rate is projected to remain elevated, declining only to around 8½ per cent by the end of 2013. </p>

Deteriorating financial conditions and ongoing fiscal consolidation, with several countries having announced additional consolidation in the light of heightened concerns about sovereign debt sustainability, will act as a drag on the economy in both 2012 and 2013. In the near term, with output expectations continuing to decline and the loss of momentum in the economy, business investment is likely to be very weak. Softening confidence, deteriorating labour market conditions and renewed balance-sheet pressures are also likely to weigh on private consumption. Provided sovereign debt and banking problems can be contained, as assumed, and supportive monetary policy actions are undertaken, confidence should gradually recover from the latter half of next year. However, the large negative output gap is projected to close only marginally in 2013. The unemployment rate is projected to remain elevated, at just over 10% at the end of 2013.</p>

Financial conditions have improved modestly through 2011, providing a stimulus to activity in 2012, and the planned fiscal package (worth 2% of GDP) is likely to boost growth by next year. Ongoing private and public reconstruction expenditure should help to support demand, though the timing of such expenditure remains uncertain. Soft global growth and the appreciation of the real exchange rate are, however, likely to check the pace of the upturn. As public reconstruction efforts fade, stronger business investment and a gradual improvement in labour market conditions should support the recovery, and allow the negative output gap to diminish gradually through the projection period.</p>

Even so, output growth in China is projected to be well below potential in the near term. Domestic demand is likely to be relatively resilient, helped by increasing public spending on social housing, but net trade is likely to be a drag on activity, reflecting both strong import growth and, in the near term, soft external demand. As inflation and monetary conditions ease, GDP is expected to pick up from around the middle of 2012 and to grow at rates close to 10% through 2013. In India, the recent moderation in activity is expected to persist through to mid-2012, given tight monetary conditions, leading to a wider negative output gap. Improving domestic confidence, easier monetary conditions and stronger external demand should help growth to pick up to around 8¼ per cent in 2013. In Brazil, domestic demand is projected to remain solid over the next two years, helped by large infrastructure programmes. However, the ongoing drag exerted by net export declines should keep GDP growth below potential rates, at around 3¼-4 per cent per annum. In Russia, GDP growth is expected to remain close to potential rates, at around 4% per annum, sustained by the still-high level of oil prices.</p>

Much of the previous run-up had stemmed from the comparative strength of commodity prices, especially in many emerging market economies.

In the United States and the euro area, the annualised rate of core inflation is projected to drift down to around 1¼ per cent over the projection period. Deflation is expected to persist in Japan, albeit at a gradually diminishing pace. In emerging countries, slower current and future growth should suffice to alleviate inflationary tensions arising from domestic capacity constraints. </p>

Stable inflation expectations can serve as a powerful buffer against entering a deflationary spiral, raising a question as to how stable these expectations really are.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s03-08-p0067" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">One means of evaluating the relationship between inflation expectations and realised inflation is to regress indicators of inflation expectations on current and lagged consumer price inflation, using a rolling window, and study the development of the sum of the estimated coefficients (Trehan 2010). In the regression results depicted below, a 15-year rolling window is used and the number of lags is set to seven quarters. The results from regressing US consumers’ short-run or long-run inflation expectations on headline inflation show that the sum of the estimated coefficients is currently lower than in 2007. Results using professional forecasters’ short-run or long-run inflation expectations are similar. These findings suggest that changes in headline inflation have had a declining impact on inflation expectations. For the euro area, results from regressing professional forecasters’ short-run or long-run inflation expectations on headline inflation show that the sum of the estimated coefficients continues to be low.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s03-08-p0068" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Therefore, even after the experience of large swings in headline inflation, inflation expectations appear to be well-anchored. This result might give grounds to hope that projected falls in headline inflation, due to weaker economic developments and falls in commodity prices, will not reduce inflation expectations sufficiently to pose significant deflation risk in the muddling-through projection. For instance, based on the coefficient estimates for the most recent period, the one percentage point fall in headline US CPI inflation in the projection between end-2011 and end-2012 would be associated with one-year-ahead inflation expectations falling by roughly ½ percentage point over the same period. This itself contributes ¼ percentage point to the fall in core inflation in 2013 based on the expectations-based Phillips curve estimated in Moccero<emphasis emph="italic"> et al. </emphasis>(2011). Similarly, in the euro area, the ¾ percentage point decline in headline inflation between end-2011 and end-2012 would reduce one-year-ahead inflation expectations by ¼ percentage point, which in turn would subtract ¼ percentage point from core inflation in 2013.</p>

The projection builds in an assumption that, as in 2008-09, widespread labour hoarding will help to preserve employment through a prolonged period of sub-par growth. Short-time working arrangements could, in principle, facilitate such labour hoarding, but their use may now be reduced, as average hours worked have still not returned to pre-crisis norms in many companies. If working hours do not adjust as much as in 2008-09, companies will either have to accept weak productivity growth as the counterpart to labour hoarding or lay off workers faster than projected.</p>

Reforms to relax regulatory restrictions in sectors in which there is a strong potential for new job growth, such as retail trade and professional services, could also serve to improve labour market outcomes relatively quickly. Some of the measures that would help to stimulate employment in the near term could also reduce the risk of the transformation of cyclical into structural unemployment and strengthen labour market performance more generally. Other possible measures that might help to improve long-term labour market outcomes, such as reductions in unemployment benefit duration, may have more negative social consequences when labour demand is weak and should be pursued in the current context only when existing policy is clearly excessive.</p>

The sum of all external balances in absolute terms is projected to remain around 3½ per cent of world GDP over the projection period, well below the level immediately prior to the crisis. Global imbalances are being kept elevated, at least in part, by the large increase in the external surpluses of the high-saving oil-producing economies, on the back of the still-high level of oil prices. Whilst re-spending of oil revenues is likely to reduce the external surpluses of oil-producing economies somewhat, much of the additional revenue accrued is likely to be saved, as appropriate for countries in which oil reserves are being depleted gradually.</p>

In the nine months to September, this deterioration more than accounted for the nominal decline in the aggregate external trade surplus of China, compared with the same period a year ago; in the United States it accounted for around two-thirds of the rise in the external trade deficit compared with the same period a year ago.<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s03-11-n07"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s03-11-p0082" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The changes in the balance of oil trade reflect both the impact of higher oil prices and changes in the volume of net oil imports. In China, where activity growth has been relatively strong, the volume of oil imports (proxied by import tonnage) in the first eight months to August was 7% higher than in the same period a year earlier. The volume of US oil imports declined in the same period.</p></fnote> In contrast, over the projection period, developments in the major economies largely reflect differences in the respective cyclical positions. The US external deficit is projected to widen by just under ½ per cent of GDP, and the euro area surplus in aggregate is projected to rise by around 1% of GDP. After a sharp decline to just over 3% of GDP in 2011, the Chinese current account surplus is projected to fall further, to around 2¼ per cent of GDP in 2013, with strong domestic demand growth helping to keep the surplus lower than in the recent past.</p>

In addition to having a direct benefit on prospects for national growth and welfare, many structural reforms are likely to help address the underlying determinants of global external imbalances over the medium term, <emphasis emph="italic">via</emphasis> their impact on national saving and investment rates (OECD, 2011b). In particular, measures that stimulate investment in external surplus economies by reducing product market regulations in sheltered sectors, in conjunction with measures to improve social welfare systems and liberalise financial markets (while ensuring adequate prudential regulation) in non-OECD economies with an external surplus, could help to narrow global imbalances in the years ahead. In external deficit economies, rebalancing could be assisted by giving priority to: measures that enhance job creation, thereby reducing incentives for firms to substitute capital for labour; reforms that improve the efficiency of the tax system, and enhance the incentive to save; and measures that enhance non-price competitiveness. As discussed below, structural reforms are also needed to durably reduce imbalances within the euro area.</p>

Indeed, recent survey indicators have underlined concerns about such a risk. Further ahead, uncertainties relate to the extent to which stable, high growth rates can be sustained in the context of the need to lower the share of fixed investment in aggregate demand.</p>

An easing of supply disruptions could, in principle, allow oil prices to fall below current levels. But the upside risk to prices remains a greater concern, with oil consumption by emerging markets continuing to trend upwards and current levels of oil stocks being fairly low.</p>

In addition, central banks should provide ample liquidity to calm tensions in financial markets. In some OECD economies where monetary tightening had already started, policy interest rates should be reduced. Near zero-interest-rate policies are not costless as they can prompt excessive risk taking and capital misallocation. Nevertheless, in the current weak economic environment with significant downward risks, such considerations are outweighed by the need to provide monetary accommodation. Indeed, given the outlook, interest rates need to be close to zero in most OECD countries over the projection period, with further support coming from non-conventional measures:</p>

In addition, the Federal Reserve decided in September to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities by the end of June 2012 (<shortcitation>Operation Twist</shortcitation>). These measures are expected to stimulate the economy by lowering medium and long-term interest rates and the yield curve indeed flattened in the wake of their announcement, especially following the former policy decision. On the basis of the projections, it would be appropriate to keep the target Federal Funds rate at the current level until end-2013. However, government bond yields are assumed to rise as safe haven considerations dissipate gradually and government debt rises.</p>

The weak prospects for the euro area economy and fading inflation strongly argue for further prompt reductions in interest rates. In the projections, the overnight interbank rate is assumed to fall to its post-Lehman low of 0.35% before the end of this year, and to stay at this level, which can be achieved through a combination of cuts in the main refinancing and deposit rates and ample liquidity provision.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s04-08-p0098" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In the large emerging market economies outside the OECD, falls in commodity prices and the slower growth of the global economy have started, or will soon start, to mitigate inflationary pressures. However, in deciding whether, when and how rapidly to ease, central banks need to take into account that inflation in some cases starts from a level well above implicit or explicit targets. In China, monetary policy has continued to be tightened gradually this year through increases in official interest rates and required reserve ratios while individual lending quotas have been applied for each bank. By contrast, the effective appreciation of the exchange rate since the beginning of the year has been very small. Going forward, and as the easing of overall monetary conditions becomes warranted, more significant appreciation of the effective exchange rate would increase the scope for a domestic policy response. A useful first step would be for the Chinese authorities to manage the exchange rate with reference to a clearly-defined basket of currencies. Without such currency policy, domestic monetary policy instruments – which are harder to calibrate – have to be kept at comparatively more restrictive levels to keep inflation on track. Such a strategy involves a risk of an excessive economic slowdown, especially if it were to trigger a downward spiral between property prices and bank capitalisation due to a potential problem of poor-quality lending in the property sector. In India, where continued high inflation has put the anchoring of inflation expectations at risk, some easing will be possible once inflation starts to decline noticeably, which is projected to occur in the second half of 2012. In Brazil, the central bank has ample room to reduce the policy rate further in response to weaker prospects for the economy.</p>

This compares with a fiscal tightening embodied in current legislation of about 2 and 3 per cent of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively, which would be excessive given the relatively weak economic outlook. This programmed tightening would be substantially reduced if the Administration’s proposed stimulus, worth some 3% of GDP in the coming two years, were to be approved by Congress, but this remains uncertain. The recent failure of a Congressional committee to conclude a bi-partisan agreement on a medium and long-term consolidation programme may weaken confidence in the long-term anchoring of fiscal policy and, thus, limit the fiscal space that the authorities have to respond more flexibly to a much weaker-than-expected economy, if that were to occur.</p>

This incorporates cumulative post-earthquake reconstruction spending of around 2% of GDP in 2012 and 2013 that is assumed to be financed only partially by higher revenues, and limits on central government primary spending, excluding reconstruction spending, to the nominal level in the initial budget for FY 2011. The revised three-year medium-term fiscal framework announced in August 2011 maintained the aims of halving the primary budget deficit (relative to GDP) of central and local governments by FY 2015, achieving a primary surplus by FY 2020 and steadily reducing the public debt ratio thereafter. However, it is yet to be decided how to attain the targets. Given the very high sovereign debt level, the top priority must be to establish a detailed and credible fiscal consolidation programme, including tax increases, spending limits and privatisation revenues.</p>

Reductions in underlying deficits are particularly steep in the IMF/EU programme countries, Italy and Spain: close to 2¾ and 1¼ per cent of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively, for the group on average. Planned consolidation must be implemented to help regain confidence. In France, fiscal tightening is set to amount to around 1¾ per cent of GDP in both 2012 and 2013. On the other hand, relatively modest annual consolidation of around ½ per cent of GDP or less is appropriately planned in some of the countries with comparatively sound public finances (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>Germany).</p>

The immediate concern is that accounting rules allow sovereign debt held in banking books to be valued at acquisition cost and not at market prices when banks declare that they intend to hold these securities to maturity. With sharp cuts in the market price of sovereign bonds issued by many countries in the euro area, this has opened up a gap between <shortcitation>market</shortcitation> and <shortcitation>accounting</shortcitation> measures of these assets. In addition, there is a lack of clarity in the treatment of sovereign bonds held in the banking book that are available for sale: under international financial reporting standards they are expected to be marked to market, but some countries are reported to have applied <shortcitation>prudential filters</shortcitation> allowing banks to value them at amortised cost for the purpose of calculating compliance with regulatory capital requirements. Another source of uncertainty about banks’ financial statements relates to the treatment of their credit default swap (CDS) exposures as it appeared in October that a significant euro area bank had previously classified them as guarantees (which can receive a special accounting treatment), meaning that it did not have to recognise mark-to-market losses. There are also concerns that some banks outside the euro area could have large exposures to vulnerable euro area countries and banks, especially through credit default swaps (see below).</p>

Capital has to be raised swiftly, to anticipate any sovereign credit events. To avoid a process of credit curtailment and generalised bank deleveraging which could prove extremely disruptive, regulators should ensure that banks increase their capital levels rather than shrinking assets. To the extent that public capital injection is needed, it should come in the form of ordinary shares so as to give tax payers a share not only in potential losses but also potential upsides. The European co-ordination process could be used to avoid <shortcitation>stigma</shortcitation> effects by making recapitalisation occur in a harmonised way across countries. This effort should extend to banks located outside the euro area that have large exposures, through loans, guarantees or derivatives, to the vulnerable countries of the euro area. </p>

              </heading>
              <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s04-17-p0109" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The 26 October Euro summit and EU Council packages set out a further series of measures to help resolve sovereign debt and banking sector problems in the euro area. The main body of measures concerned proposals for Greece, steps to enhance the effectiveness of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), bank recapitalisation, bank term funding and further significant enhancements of economic governance. Overall, the elements of the package represent a significant step towards resolving the euro area crises. However, the critical details remain to be determined and the measures have not succeeded in damping sovereign debt market tensions. A stronger link would also be appropriate with structural reform commitments and policy actions to enhance growth and rebalancing in the euro area – elements that are crucial to address the economic imbalances at the root of the crisis.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s04-17-p0110" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Concerning Greece, the summit invited the Greek government, private investors and other parties concerned to develop a voluntary bond exchange with a nominal 50% discount on notional Greek sovereign debt held by private investors, with the aim of putting Greek public finances on course to achieve a government debt stock of 120% of GDP by 2020. This would be some 30% of GDP lower than implied by earlier plans announced at a summit in July. Euro area countries would contribute up to e30bn to this new package. On that basis, additional official programme financing of up to e100bn until 2014 would be provided, including the additional resources required for the recapitalisation of Greek banks.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1181702" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">If it can be achieved, this package would help ensure greater economic stability in Greece but may not fully put concerns about debt sustainability to rest, given the still-high debt level that is projected at the end of the decade. The extent of private sector participation also remains unknown, with some financial institutions possibly preferring to hold out for either repayment in full or an involuntary debt write-down, given their offsetting credit default swap (CDS) positions that would be triggered in such an event. In addition, the basis for calculating the 50% discount remains to be determined. More generally, if the large Greek write-down is ultimately treated as voluntary, investors might question whether holding CDS offers much protection against possible write-downs of their other holdings of sovereign bonds, adding to uncertainty about the balance sheet positions of financial institutions.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1181707" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">On the EFSF, two options were proposed to increase its capacity and raise the resources available to help achieve stability in the euro area :</p>
              <randlist type="bullet">
                <li id="OCDEid1211842" numbering="n">
                  <p id="OCDEid1181712" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Providing credit enhancement to new debt issued by member states to reduce funding costs. Private investors would have the option of purchasing this risk insurance when buying bonds in the primary market.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="OCDEid1211850" numbering="n">
                  <p id="OCDEid1181717" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Maximising the funding arrangements of the EFSF through a combination of resources from private and public financial institutions and investors, arranged through Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) on the back of equity provided by the EFSF. If successful, this would enlarge the amount of resources available to extend loans and provide credit enhancements, for bank recapitalisation and for buying bonds in the primary and secondary markets.</p>
                </li>
              </randlist>
              <p id="OCDEid1181722" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The EFSF would have flexibility to use these two options simultaneously and deploy them for different objectives as required. For instance enhanced purchases of bonds in the secondary market could be required if the risk insurance available on newly issued sovereign debt resulted in existing debt, without such risk insurance, coming under increased pressure. The precise leverage effect of each option could be up to four or five times the available resources of the EFSF at present.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1181727" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The feasibility of the schemes remains unclear. In particular, the success of the proposed SPVs will depend on the extent to which investors are willing to finance the sovereign debt of vulnerable countries at yields which do not threaten debt sustainability. As any extension of the sovereign guarantees underpinning the EFSF was ruled out, possible leverage and costs thereof remain dependent on the extent to which bond market contagion to the countries that guarantee the EFSF can be contained. Using first-loss insurance as a means to increase leverage effectively extends coverage by reducing the impact on yields.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1181732" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The third main announcement comprised new measures to support the European banking system:</p>
              <randlist type="bullet">
                <li id="OCDEid1181740" numbering="n">
                  <p id="OCDEid1181743" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Banks have a deadline of June 2012 to raise their <shortcitation>core</shortcitation> capital ratios to 9% after marking to market their holdings of sovereign debt as of end-September. Estimates by the European Banking Authority (EBA) suggest that the total capital shortfall to be made up is e106 billion (around 1% of euro area GDP). Plans for achieving the capital ratio target have to be agreed with national supervisors and co-ordinated by the EBA, in order to prevent excessive deleveraging.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="OCDEid1181763" numbering="n">
                  <p id="OCDEid1181766" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The necessary additional finance should initially be raised from private sources, including through the restructuring and conversion of debt to equity. If necessary, national governments should provide support, and if this was not available, recapitalisation of euro area banks should be funded by a loan from the EFSF to the national authorities. Banks that fail to meet the new capital target are also to be subject to constraints on dividend payouts and bonus payments by regulators until the targets are met.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="OCDEid1181772" numbering="n">
                  <p id="OCDEid1181775" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">There was also an agreement to establish a co-ordinated EU-level approach that would establish public guarantee schemes to support banks’ access to term funding at reasonable conditions.</p>
                </li>
              </randlist>
              <p id="OCDEid1185069" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">These steps are much needed to help restore confidence in the European banking sector, although their effectiveness remains to be seen. Bond yields in many euro area countries have risen markedly further (hence weakening bond values) since the end of September, possibly implying that an even larger additional level of capital might now be prudent for some banks. There is also a clear danger that the new capital ratios will be achieved through deleveraging, with banks discriminating between domestic and foreign borrowers and concentrating lending activities in home markets only. This could be a particular problem in smaller European economies in which foreign banks have a large market share. To guard against this, it would be preferable if the objectives for individual banks could instead be specified as targets for the amount of capital raised.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1185074" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Where governments take equity stakes, there is a strong case for doing so in the form of ordinary shares, which have the benefit of diluting existing shareholders (reducing moral hazard) and giving the public purse a benefit if banks’ fortunes improve: this approach would contrast with the 2008-09 episode when for the most part fiscal authorities recapitalised banks through means which exposed taxpayers to equity-like risk but gave them debt-like returns. Taking ordinary shares would also enable governments to exercise their shareholder rights, which could facilitate efforts to suspend dividend payments and to cap compensation per employee in order to improve balance sheets as quickly as possible without curtailing credit supply.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1185079" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Finally, on governance, a number of significant new political commitments were made to reinforce the co-ordination and surveillance of euro area policies. In particular:</p>

Financial markets have priced in a restructuring of sovereign debt in Greece with large losses for creditors and also significant contagion to other fiscally vulnerable members of the euro area. This is particularly so for Italy and Spain, with government bond yield spreads surging towards levels that are ultimately hard to sustain, but also Belgium and, to a lesser extent, France and Austria. Indeed, contagion has entered a new phase and spread beyond euro area countries normally seen as fiscally vulnerable, suggesting that fiscal concerns are no longer the only driving force behind contagion. The policy measures announced at the Euro Summit and the EU Council meeting on 26 October (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-bs04"/>), like previous policy packages, provided only a temporary respite to market pressures. </p>

An orderly debt write-down, without invoking CDS trigger clauses, might have only muted cross-border impact; a disorderly default, with comparatively large losses for investors and the triggering of CDS credit clauses, could give rise to uncontrollable contagion to other vulnerable countries. Accentuated concerns about the future integrity of the euro area could, even in the absence of sovereign defaults, lead to disorderly financial market developments with substantial economic fall-out. The trigger of a downside scenario could even be a separate event, for example the threatened collapse of one or more large financial institutions.</p>

In general, in the absence of a clear and credible policy commitment to halt contagion, backed by resources that are seen to be adequate, some form of downside scenario would become ever more probable; alternatively, if such a commitment is made, and succeeds in restoring confidence, an upside scenario will become more likely.</p>

First, investors would realise that default can occur. Secondly, default in one country would create a precedent, which could result in other fiscally challenged countries considering it as one possible way of adjusting. Thirdly, the fiscal positions of other euro area countries could be weakened by losses on official bilateral loans, calls on EFSF guarantees or the need to recapitalise or resolve domestic banks with large exposures to the defaulting country. Such contagion would show up in higher government bond yields, further undermining public finances. Furthermore, were a default to strengthen expectations of euro-area exit, other weak countries might also see their bond yields increased by fears of a domino effect.</p>

If a credit event occured, whether voluntary or otherwise, creditor banks would have to write down the value of their claims on the Greek government, amounting to e34 billion as of end-2010 for EU banks outside Greece (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDBHBEJ"/>).<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-13-n10"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-13-p0141" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Even in the absence of a default, some of this outstanding amount is likely to be written down provided private sector investors participate in the voluntary bond exchange programme announced at the Euro Summit in October. </p></fnote> National banking systems should be able to absorb significant losses on their Greek sovereign debt holdings with their current <shortcitation>free</shortcitation> Core Tier 1 capital (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e. </emphasis>the capital above the required minimum of 4½ per cent of risk-weighted assets applicable under Basel III as from 2015). Public capital injections to make up for the write-downs might be needed for individual, particularly heavily exposed banks, but should be small relative to GDP.<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-13-n11"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-13-p0142" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Banks that are net sellers of credit default swap (CDS) protection on Greek sovereign debt would suffer losses in the case of default, but the small size of the market for Greek sovereign CDS suggests that the impact should be limited, unless it were to be highly concentrated. The overall notional amount of outstanding sovereign Greek CDS contracts has been estimated at below e8 billion (Baker, 2011).</p></fnote> As
provided for in the October Euro Summit agreement, banks could incur additional losses on Greek private assets as the domestic banking system and, in the case of a general default, the non-bank private sector would most likely find it difficult to fully meet their obligations. Indeed, foreign claims on non-government entities in Greece are as large as claims on the government. Nonetheless, banking systems should also be able to absorb such losses without much public assistance in the form of capital injections, though particularly exposed institutions could face problems. Inter-bank markets could seize-up in the immediate wake of a default announcement, but already-announced central bank liquidity provision should contain the adverse effects of this on the functioning of the broader financial system. Foreign non-bank private creditors, who hold an estimated e65 billion of Greek government debt (20% of the total), would also be affected in the case of a default and this could be the case for official creditors, who hold claims amounting to e73 billion in Greece (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-13-g013"/>).</p>

This is particularly so for Italy, where long-term government bond yields have risen rapidly by more than 100 basis points in the month to mid-November, but also Spain and Belgium, notwithstanding differences in their initial government debt levels, budget deficits, bond-yield spreads and potential growth prospects. Major negative turns in market sentiment, of the sort that in the past have been reflected in increases of 350 basis points in long-term government bond yields in affected countries,<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-15-n12"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-15-p0146" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">For instance, as uncertainty grew about the effective lending capacity of the EFSF, Irish and Portuguese yields rose by almost 3½ per cent from mid-June to mid-July 2011.</p></fnote> could have dire consequences for the public finances and the banking sector. However, the strong increase in the yield spreads of Italian, Spanish and Belgian government bonds over German bonds observed in recent months may already incorporate part of this contagion effect. Moreover, the level of bond yields is being cushioned to some extent by lower German bond yields, which could continue to be the case. Against this background, the stylised quantifications below, based on a 350 basis point increase in yields (relative to that in the muddling through projection), could be overly pessimistic:</p>

The increase in yields would imply a reduction of around a quarter in the market value of sovereign bonds issued by the three countries. This would have the biggest effects on the domestic banks in these countries, given their vast holdings of domestic sovereign debt. However, outside these three countries, pressures on banks could also become stronger, as has already been seen in France. Weaker balance sheets could possibly prompt deleveraging that would sharply curtail credit extension and raise fears that government funds would be required to safeguard the banking system. In turn, any perceived need for government-funded bank recapitalisation would exacerbate sovereign debt stress, pushing yields higher. The significant widening of French government bond spreads in the wake of French bank funding stress since mid-2011 illustrates the potential strength of this crisis amplification channel.</p>

For example, banks in the United States and Japan would take a hit on their holdings of sovereign, bank and non-bank debt of the euro area countries in question, though the total direct exposure to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Belgium is small relative to Tier-1 capital in the US and Japanese banking system (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDHFDBF"/>). US banks have large gross exposures to Europe through guarantees, including gross CDS exposure; however, their net exposures are likely to be substantially smaller due to accompanying hedging operations, as long as the counterparties are solid.<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-19-n13"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-19-p0152" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In mid-2011, the stock of credit default swaps sold by the top 25 US commercial banks and trust companies in derivatives was almost equal to total credit default swaps bought by the same institutions, see Comptroller of the Currency (2011).</p></fnote> Little is known about the exposure of US and Japanese non-bank financial institutions to the euro area countries.</p>

However, equity markets in the two countries would be hit as profits of US and Japanese exporters to Europe would fall, as would earnings of subsidiaries of US and Japanese companies in Europe. This effect would likely be reinforced by a general reduction in risk appetite. Heightened general risk aversion would also be an important channel by which emerging market economies would be affected by an intense crisis in the euro area, with large-scale capital outflows depressing economic growth in addition to the effect of much weaker export markets. </p>

These estimates are highly stylised and only illustrative. They consider only a restricted sample of countries despite the recent generalisation of contagion, and they do not discriminate among the three countries concerned in spite of their present differences in fiscal situations and government bond yields. That said, the estimates highlight the scale of the policy challenge involved if such a scenario did occur, and the urgency of taking action to put in place mechanisms that can prevent it from occurring.</p>

It assumes that contagion from a disorderly sovereign debt restructuring, for instance in Greece, is widespread in the euro area and, as a very stylised assumption, equally reflected in sovereign debt markets in Italy, Spain and Belgium, notwithstanding present differences in their fiscal positions and government bond yields. The scenario does not allow for the possibility of exit from the euro area, or for stronger expectations thereof, or for possible major discontinuities that might arise if any major financial institutions ceased to operate. The effects shown should be seen relative to the muddling-through projection, which incorporates the impact of the deterioration in financial conditions that has already occurred since the summer.</p>
              <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s06-02-p0180" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Given the likely global nature of the downturn and the key role of financial market contagion, as in the 2008-09 crisis, the downside scenario is calibrated on developments observed in that crisis. In particular, the deterioration in credit conditions, corporate bond spreads and equity prices between the latter half of 2007 (the half-year prior to the onset of a generalised collapse in confidence) and the height of the crisis in the first quarter of 2009 has been used to calibrate a benchmark for the declines that could occur in major OECD economies in this downside scenario. These benchmark declines are applied to the average value of credit conditions, bond spreads and equity prices in the six month period to July this year (the corresponding six months before the collapse in confidence began in August). The resulting calibrated levels of credit conditions, bond spreads and equity prices are assumed to be reached by the second quarter of 2012, and to remain at this level until end-2012. Thereafter, the reversion in these variables towards more normal, pre-crisis levels is assumed to be protracted compared with 2008-09, reflecting the more limited scope for sizable support from macroeconomic policies at the current conjuncture. In addition, as discussed in the main text, long-term government bond yields in this stylised scenario are also assumed to rise by 350 basis points in Italy, Spain and Belgium, in line with past experience following major turns in financial market sentiment. In practice, if such a scenario materialised, the situation in each country could differ, reflecting their different starting positions.</p>

The decline in the FCIs implies, all else being equal, that the level of output in the major OECD economies (and the output gap) could be around 5% lower by the first half of 2013 than might otherwise be the case. A change of this magnitude from the muddling-through baseline would be associated with a deep recession in the euro area, and also push the United States and Japan into recession. It would also give rise to strong disinflationary, or even deflationary, forces. Financial conditions in the emerging market economies might also be strongly adversely affected in such circumstances, not least because of the likely rise in financial outflows from these countries as OECD financial institutions repatriate capital.</p>

As above, the changes between the latter half of 2007 and the height of the crisis in 2008-09 have been used to calibrate the changes in uncertainty and confidence, using the average value over February-July 2011 as a starting point.</p>

Such changes would likely have an adverse impact on near-term potential growth, by lowering the capital stock. The investment impact in the United States could even be larger than in the euro area, reflecting a greater estimated sensitivity of investment to changes in both the FCI and uncertainty in the United States. Private consumption would also weaken considerably; all else equal, the growth of private consumption would be lowered by around 2 percentage points in 2012 in the euro area and the United States, and by close to 3 percentage points in 2013 relative to the muddling-through projection.</p>

              <p id="OCDEid1191704" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">A broader picture of the possible near-term outcomes and effects in this downside scenario can be obtained from simulations on NiGEM, the global macroeconomic model of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. This allows a full account to be taken of the spillovers between countries arising from changes in trade and international financial linkages <emphasis emph="italic">via</emphasis> asset prices and net foreign asset accumulation.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1191713" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">In a simulation of the downside scenario, equity risk premia, corporate bond spreads, household sector interest rate spreads, equity prices and euro area bond yields are changed as set out above for the changes applied to recalibrate the FCIs. In addition, the simulation incorporates a 40% decline in equity prices worldwide (again reflecting the pattern of changes between the latter half of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009) and a stylised rise of 350 basis points in long-term government bond rates in Italy, Spain and Belgium. All shocks are assumed, for simplicity, to persist fully for two years. Policy interest rates are assumed to remain at their baseline settings (close to the zero bound). Budget solvency rules are turned off, so that the full effect of the downturn is reflected in the automatic stabilisers, apart from in the six euro area countries assumed to be at the heart of the crisis in this scenario (the programme countries, Italy, Spain and Belgium) and Japan, which as discussed in the main text on the OECD Strategic Response to a potential new relapse in economic activity, would have to at least partly offset the automatic stabilisers to avoid losses in market confidence about sovereign debt sustainability.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1191718" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Broadly in line with the results above, the simulation results (see the Table below) point to a likely prolonged and deep recession in the euro area in the absence of any discretionary policy responses, given the already weak area-wide activity in the muddling-through baseline. The OECD as a whole would move into recession, with marked declines in activity in both the United States and Japan. The emerging market economies would not be immune from this shock, with global trade volumes around 9½ per cent lower than baseline after two years, and the value of their international asset holdings being hit by weaker equity prices. Differences across countries in the response to the shock reflect differences in the sensitivity of expenditure to changes in financial conditions and asset values in the macroeconomic model, as well as differences in real and nominal rigidities. In part, these help to account for the relatively slow first year response of euro area activity to the shocks. The response in Japan is relatively large, in part because the automatic fiscal stabilisers (which are small to begin with) are being offset by other fiscal measures so that the headline budget balance remains unchanged, and in part because of the relative sensitivity of net exports to changes in demand and the real exchange rate.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1191723" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Disinflationary forces would intensify, with deflation likely occurring in many OECD economies by 2013, given the already low level of inflation in the main projection and the gradual extent to which stronger disinflation begins to push down inflation expectations. Unemployment would also rise sharply, by close to 2 percentage points in the OECD economies by 2013, and possibly even by more if past labour hoarding now led firms to reduce employment levels more actively. If other governments made efforts to stick to their announced fiscal objectives for the headline budget balance, the necessary further <emphasis emph="italic">ex-ante</emphasis> fiscal tightening in the remaining euro area economies would exceed 1% of GDP in 2012 and over 2½ per cent of GDP in 2013; if implemented such changes would further intensify the adverse near-term effects on growth.</p>

For instance, this could be prompted by the need to restore external competitiveness after a large erosion since entry into the currency union. Although this would most likely prove to be extremely costly for the country in question in the short run, and possibly even in the long run,<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-22-n14"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-22-p0157" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Empirical estimates made after a decade of monetary union in Europe suggested that the combined direct and indirect benefits on area-wide productivity from the move to a single currency could be as high as 5% in the long run (EC, 2008). The break-up of the euro area would put such gains at risk.</p></fnote> euro-area exit might nevertheless be seen as a politically less unappealing option for countries under market pressure. As a consequence, investors would start demanding compensation for possible exchange rate risk in the form of higher interest rates on public and private debt in other vulnerable countries that remain members of the euro area. There would also be strong incentives for households and businesses to withdraw deposits from these vulnerable countries, creating a potential for bank runs to add to economic instability.</p>

Such turbulence in Europe, with the massive wealth destruction, bankruptcies and a collapse in confidence in European integration and cooperation, would most likely result in a deep depression in both the exiting and remaining euro area countries as well as in the world economy.</p>

The measures announced at the October Euro Summit and EU Council meeting go some way towards this objective, but have not proved sufficient to damp market tensions. Fully-credible commitments to halt contagion to otherwise solvent sovereigns should result in a significant reduction in long-term rates in the countries concerned, with improved confidence and lower uncertainty prompting households and businesses to increase spending. Various ring-fencing mechanisms have different intermediate aims and would require significantly different resource commitments, and include the following:</p>

This would go beyond the measures announced at the recent Euro Summit. To be credible, such a policy would need to be backed by an ample level of resources – even if credibility would imply that few resources would have to be actually disbursed. This might imply a sizeable share of the combined size of the bond markets in the three countries, which amounts to around e3 trillion (around 30% of GDP in the euro area) (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-24-g015"/>, Panel A). A full guarantee of public debt of these countries would imply similarly large outlays in case of default and would therefore have to be backed by a similar level of resources to be credible, though outlays would be delayed compared with direct interventions to control the bond markets. Partial guarantees would require fewer resources, but would also likely be less effective in reducing yields.<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-24-n15"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-24-p0161" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">The impact of partial guarantees, <emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> guaranteeing losses up to a certain per cent, would depend on the scope of such programmes. Guaranteeing a certain percentage of all existing and new debt should lead to a reduction in yields, although the impact is uncertain and depends on which combination of loss-given-default and probability of default is reflected in current spreads and on how the probability of default would be reassessed after the introduction of a guarantee. As an illustrative example, Italian government bond spreads over swaps
as of 18 November 2011 can be interpreted as reflecting an implied probability of default of 6.1% a year over the next ten years using the value-weighted average loss-given-default rate of 69%, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e.</emphasis> the average of the episodes of default surveyed in Moody’s (2011). Under this assumption, a 20% guarantee would reduce yields by less than 140 basis points. If, alternatively, loss-given-default is assumed to be equal to the un-weighted average of 47% in the study, the associated implied probability of default is 10.9% a year and the yield reduction for a 20% guarantee would reach almost 200 basis points. </p></fnote> In the longer term, jointly issued or jointly guaranteed euro-bonds could achieve the same effects but would likely take time to introduce and would raise similar types of moral hazard concerns.</p>

In the cases of Italy, Spain and Belgium for 2012 and 2013, this would require resources equivalent to around e1 trillion (10% of GDP in the euro area) (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-24-g015"/>, Panel B). However, such interventions would not necessarily imply low yields in secondary markets for government bonds, as demonstrated by the currently high yields in the programme countries, and knock-on effects on domestic banking systems could increase public funding requirements considerably. In addition, high yields would have adverse effects on creditor banks in other euro area countries.</p>

Again using Italy, Spain and Belgium as an example, the resources required for this, if the guarantee became effective, would be equal to EU bank holdings of sovereign debt of the 3 countries, amounting to around e0.7 trillion (7% of GDP in the euro area) (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="Figure" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-24-g015"/>, Panel C).</p>

Indeed, the different actors could be assigned different tasks in ring-fencing strategies with many different permutations possible.<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-25-n16"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s05-25-p0166" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">For example, the EFSF could be tasked to deal with current programme countries and bank recapitalisation in vulnerable countries, national authorities with capital injections into banks in the stronger countries, and the ECB with ensuring that bond yields in vulnerable countries do not turn too high; the ECB could ensure low sovereign bond yields in both programme and vulnerable countries, thereby minimising losses for the European banking system, with the EFSF’s role being limited to inject the capital into banks that might still be needed in vulnerable countries, <emphasis emph="italic">etc</emphasis>. </p></fnote> Successful ring-fencing with official means would limit potential losses for private banks.

However, it might prove difficult in practice to raise the capacity of the EFSF sufficiently, especially if funds were needed to support a large number of countries and private banks. Because of practical, legal and political economy barriers, the ECB would most likely have to play a key role in providing the required resources – possibly via the EFSF which would help ensure a more appropriate allocation of credit risk. The ECB can sterilise any expansion of its balance sheet and, more to the point, can use its deposit rate to steer market interest rates independently of outstanding liquidity should this become necessary. However, such a strategy could come at the cost of the ECB becoming heavily engaged in quasi-fiscal operations, and moral hazard could be created that could render inflation control difficult in the future. Set against this, a credible and decisive programme may not increase ECB exposure compared with the end result of the current drip-wise intervention under the Securities Market Programme. Irrespective of the institutional mechanisms employed, access to resources should only be made with strict conditionality, so that strong corrective action is taken by the receiving country.</p>

In particular, it is necessary to establish mechanisms to counter the potential moral hazard from intervening to block contagion. There are various options available to attain that end: stronger adherence to central rules and automatic penalties for non-compliance, <emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>monetary fines or the federation taking control of national VAT rates to attain targets; blue/red bonds that would provide countries with incentives to prevent their debt exceeding a certain limit where they could no longer benefit from low interest rates backed by a federal guarantee; increased use of market mechanisms to discipline fiscal behaviour, which would require establishing a framework for orderly sovereign default; etc. These options differ in terms of the extent of administrative and market control, and the ultimate arrangement will depend on members’ preferences in these matters, but the multiplicity of possible solutions should not delay the adoption of adequate arrangements. At its October 2011 meeting, the EU Council agreed to expand administrative controls to limit the risk of excessive deficits of individual member countries in the future (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-bs04"/>) and further measures are under discussion.</p>

In particular, there would likely be a marked reduction in long-term government bond spreads in many euro area countries, as well as a more general improvement in financial conditions and restoration of confidence. An illustrative scenario is set out in <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-bs06"/>, incorporating a reduction in euro area government bond yield spreads and the rapid reversal of the decline in financial conditions since August. The results suggest that OECD output growth could be 1¼-1½ percentage points higher in 2013 than in the muddling-through projection, and considerably higher than would be the case if a downside scenario had materialised.</p>

The effects shown should be seen relative to the muddling-through projection, which incorporates the impact of the deterioration in financial conditions and the rise in long-term government bond yields that has occurred since the summer. They do not incorporate any potential near-term effects from structural reforms announced as part of a package to help restore market confidence.</p>

In all economies, allowance is also made for an assumed rise of 20% in equity prices and small reductions in risk premia and private sector interest rate spreads. The latter reductions correspond to approximately one-quarter of the increases included in the downside scenario (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-bs05"/>), broadly taking these financial variables back to their level in the six months to July this year before risk aversion was heightened in August. Thus, there is an easing in financial conditions outside the euro area as well as inside. In the macroeconomic model simulation of this scenario, all shocks are assumed, for simplicity, to persist fully for two years. Policy interest rates are assumed to remain at their baseline settings. Budget solvency rules are turned off other than In the three euro area programme countries plus Italy, Spain and Belgium, who are assumed to continue to meet their target headline budget balances, implying a modest fiscal easing in these countries relative to the muddling-through projection.</p>
              <p id="OCDEid1236981" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Model simulations suggest that such changes might raise OECD output growth by between ¾‑1 percentage point in 2012 and between 1¼-1½ percentage points in 2013 (see the Table below).

Thus, in the first year, the euro area GDP increase is only marginally faster than in the rest of the OECD. Overall, when combined with the muddling-through baseline, the upside scenario would imply the euro area growing at more than twice its estimated potential growth rate in 2013.</p>

Inflationary pressures would be somewhat stronger, but not strong in an absolute sense given the disinflationary pressures in the muddling-through projection. There would also be improved fiscal outcomes in the euro area, with the budget balance improving by over 1% of GDP by 2013. Such an outcome would also likely be accompanied by improvements in private sector confidence and reductions in uncertainty, which would also be expected to boost expenditure relative to the muddling-through projection.</p>

Symptoms amongst the weaker economies have included: weak competitiveness, loss of market shares and external deficits; low growth that has exacerbated fiscal imbalances through adverse debt dynamics; and over-reliance on domestic demand to drive growth. Amongst the stronger economies, growth has been excessively reliant on exports, and domestic saving has been used only partially to finance domestic investment (which has fallen relative to GDP), with surplus saving flowing to finance consumption and investments, with sometimes very weak or even negative returns, in weaker economies. Going forward, there is a need to not only establish sound fiscal policies, but also to: ensure that private saving and investment decisions are based on sound incentives; ensure that cumulated competitiveness positions converge quickly towards levels that are sustainable in the long term; and ensure that growth is not held back by policy barriers. The more rapidly such adjustments occur, the shorter the period in which weaker economies have to live with high unemployment and depressed activity. Structural reforms are crucial for achieving rebalancing and for speeding up the process of adjustment. In addition, structural reforms will also help economies to cope with, and adjust more flexibly to, future economic shocks.</p>

The potential growth rate is estimated to be around 1¼ per cent in the euro area as a whole, with markedly lower rates in some of the countries facing intense market pressure. Although implementing growth-enhancing structural reforms is important in all euro area countries, it is particularly urgent to introduce reforms in the countries faced with serious credibility problems. In addition, at the EU level; reforms to strengthen and deepen the Single Market; the effective implementation of the new procedure for the surveillance and correction of macroeconomic imbalances, and financial sector reforms all have an important role to play. In the financial sector, a truly unified banking system, where all regulatory and supervisory responsibilities are transferred to the euro area level, is especially necessary to eliminate the return of adverse feedback loops between national banking systems and sovereign debt.</p>

However, against the backdrop of extremely weak area-wide inflation, progress in rebalancing competitiveness may be modest in some countries, reflecting downward rigidities in wages and prices. Structural reforms that boosted productivity growth would clearly help. The actual and planned implementation of structural reforms to enhance product and labour market flexibility would also support the necessary adjustment of the real exchange rate required to regain external competitiveness. Amongst the programme countries, adjustment is continuing to proceed relatively rapidly in Ireland, in part reflecting the relatively low level of rigidities in Irish labour and product markets. Declines in unit labour costs are also projected in Greece and Portugal in both 2012 and 2013. Other external-deficit countries in the euro area (including Italy and Spain) also have significant scope to reform labour and product markets to strengthen competitiveness and growth prospects, starting with reductions in labour-market dualism and regulatory barriers to competition.</p>

Existing legislation, including the Budget Control Act of August, implies that in the absence of offsetting action there could be a fiscal tightening of, respectively, up to 2 and 3 per cent of GDP in 2012 and 2013 (when the extensions of the 2001-03 tax cuts are set to expire, and automatic expenditure reductions worth around ¾ percentage point of GDP would be enacted). In contrast, the normative assumptions in the projection build in a fiscal consolidation worth only ½ per cent of GDP in 2012 and 1% of GDP in 2013.</p>

The pattern of the activity effects in the simulation reflects the contrasting natures of the shocks applied in 2012 and 2013; the near-term effect on activity from a direct cut in government consumption (which weighs heavily in 2012) is much larger than the near-term multiplier effect from a rise in household income taxes (which weighs heavily in 2013), particularly in circumstances in which much of the revenue is likely to come from middle-to-high income earners with a lower propensity to consume.<fnote id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s06-03-n19"><p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-s06-03-p0199" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">This abstracts from possible longer-term differences in the effects on economic growth of changes in government consumption expenditure and taxes on income. The size of the simulation responses might also vary if forward-looking behaviour was allowed for in the simulations. </p></fnote> Even so, activity remains well below its baseline level in 2013, with the US unemployment rate rising by over ½ percentage point. This would have negative, but relatively mild, spillover effects elsewhere, damping output growth in other economies by around ¼ percentage point in 2012, and reducing the level of world trade by around 1% that year. If the additional fiscal consolidation in the United States were to also lead to a depreciation of the US dollar, then the effects on US activity would be muted, while the effects on activity in other economies would be somewhat larger. </p>

The results of a combined simulation on NiGEM of the euro area downside scenario (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="Box" refid="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c02-bs05"/>) and the tighter US fiscal policy described above are shown in <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="Table" refid="CHDBFDJH"/>. In the OECD as a whole, GDP would be lower by around 6% after two years, and the level of world trade would be reduced by around 10½ per cent. Unemployment would rise sharply, by more than 2½ percentage points in the United States and by over 2 percentage points in Europe. With the induced reduction in inflation coming on top of the already low rate of price increases in the muddling-through projection, deflation would likely be widespread. In such a situation, a broad strategic policy response across countries would be called for to arrest the decline in output. The available macroeconomic and structural policy options at the national level to respond to much greater weakness than embodied in the muddling-through scenario are set out below.</p>

In general, the structural policy recommendations build on analyses reported in <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> on the most effective measures to adopt in a crisis. While these reforms would be beneficial in other, more clement, states of the world, they would have added urgency if activity relapsed. They should be accompanied by multilateral confidence-building measures, such as the conclusion of the Doha trade round and the further strengthening of the global financial system as planned by the G20.

The muddling-through projection already assumes that policy interest rates are taken down to, or maintained at, close-to-zero levels in most OECD areas. However, there would still be scope in a number of countries to reduce official interest rates, including in Canada, Australia, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Sweden and Turkey. In addition, many countries and areas (including the United States, Japan, the euro area and the United Kingdom) could make further use of unconventional monetary measures, such as increasing purchases of domestic government debt. Such strategies would risk being subject to diminishing returns, possibly requiring the use of additional unconventional instruments, such as commitment and communication policies, or even purchases to be concentrated in more risky private securities. As an ultimate recourse, fiscal instruments could be used to generate negative real after-tax interest rates. Outside the OECD area, there is significant scope in most countries to relax monetary policy to offset a renewed unexpected weakness.</p>

Such reforms are warranted in around half of all OECD countries (including Italy, United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Turkey) and outside the OECD area, in Indonesia and South Africa.</p>

Increasing the capacity of large banks in Switzerland to absorb losses would also become critical. In the United States, enhancing the possibility of refinancing mortgage loans at a low rate could be a particularly effective counter-cyclical device.</p>

Although there have been some signs of healing in financial markets, equity market losses and declines in house prices have again weighed on household wealth. All of these factors will continue to restrain demand for some time, but gradual improvements in confidence and accommodative monetary policy should help bring about an acceleration in output growth after mid‑2012</emphasis>.</p>

There have been some indications that credit supply conditions are improving, though at a slower pace than earlier in the year, and survey data indicate that banks are more willing to extend new loans. Significant progress has been made in private-sector deleveraging, with household financial obligations well below their peak and businesses accumulating large cash balances. But with equity markets having moved down again and consumer sentiment near its all-time low, consumption growth is projected to remain modest for several quarters. Once balance-sheet pressures and fears about the outlook lessen in intensity, growth should pick up gradually.</p>

A sustained recovery in the sector remains some time off, as the overhang of unsold homes, including a large <shortcitation>shadow</shortcitation> inventory of houses not yet on the market, remains high. Elevated foreclosure rates also suggest further inflows of distressed properties are ahead. Mortgage rates have fallen to historical lows, but many households are not in a position to take advantage of the favourable financing, or they are reluctant to buy in an uncertain pricing environment. Outside of the housing sector, business investment has been expanding at a healthy pace, probably reflecting the release of some pent-up demand as businesses replace their ageing capital. But with capacity utilisation at low levels, and the indicators of business sentiment having deteriorated, the pace of non-residential investment growth is likely to step down in the coming quarters.</p>

And the share of long-term unemployment is likely to remain stubbornly high, highlighting the continued risk of rising structural unemployment.</p>

Deficit reduction needs to be calibrated to maintain credibility in medium-term consolidation goals while not forestalling the fragile recovery. To this end, the projection assumes that the pace of fiscal consolidation over the next two years is limited to a reduction in the underlying primary deficit of 1½ percentage points of GDP, considerably less than would occur if there were no change in current law.</p>

While the agreed caps on discretionary spending and the new process to achieve additional savings over the next 10 years are welcome developments, more needs to be done to secure fiscal sustainability. A credible commitment to fiscal sustainability would aid the recovery by increasing confidence, reducing uncertainty and lowering the risk of disruptive logjams over the federal debt ceiling and possible resulting government shutdowns.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">After a sharp contraction in the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, the economy began to rebound in May 2011. Public and private reconstruction spending will drive the recovery through mid-2012, with growth of 2% for the year. As public reconstruction outlays wane, the expansion will be supported through 2013 by a pick-up in export growth that improves labour market conditions and boosts private consumption. Given the large output gap, deflationary pressures are likely to continue through 2013, with the unemployment rate remaining above its pre-2008 crisis level. </emphasis>

Despite electricity shortages and supply chain disruptions, industrial production has risen to within 8% of its pre-earthquake peak. However, the pace of recovery is now moderating after an initial spurt. Moreover, the initial rebound in some confidence indicators has been reversed, reflecting concerns about the strength of the world economy and the appreciation of the yen, which has risen 7% in effective terms since May.</p>

Public spending, which is focused on infrastructure, is being supplemented by business and residential investment to rebuild private firms’ fixed capital and housing.</p>

Surcharges on personal and corporate tax income will be the main sources of additional revenue. Other government spending in 2012-13 will be constrained in line with the three-year medium-term fiscal framework announced in August 2011. This aims to cut the central and local governments’ primary budget deficit by half by financial year (FY) 2015 and achieve a primary surplus and stabilise the public debt ratio by FY 2020, a target that is essential to foster fiscal sustainability. To meet these objectives, central government spending (excluding debt repayment and interest) and the issuance of conventional government bonds are to be limited to their initial FY 2011 levels. Even if these targets are met, the budget deficit will remain around 9½ per cent of GDP (excluding one-off factors) through 2013. Consequently, gross government debt is projected to approach 230% of GDP in 2013, pushing Japan’s public finances further into uncharted territory.</p>

As public investment’s contribution to growth fades, the pace of the expansion is likely to moderate. Nevertheless, business and residential investment are expected to help sustain the recovery through 2013. Moreover, the pick-up in world trade in 2012-13 will boost Japanese exports. Deflationary pressures, though, may remain headwinds for growth through 2013. </p>

Delays in re-opening these plants – or in securing alternative energy sources – could constrain output growth. In addition, the delay in fiscal consolidation and the continuing rise in the public debt ratio compound the risk of a run-up in long-term interest rates. Finally, the risk of a sharp deterioration in the world economy creates great uncertainty about the projection.</p>

With a budget deficit of 9½ per cent of GDP (excluding one-off factors) in 2012-13 and gross public debt set to rise to almost 230% of GDP, Japan does not have scope for additional fiscal measures to cope with any renewed weakness in economic activity and in that event would have to at least partly offset the automatic stabilisers, which in any case are relatively small.</p>

Given the large deterioration in the fiscal situation and long period of consolidation ahead, improving the fiscal policy framework would help to bolster confidence in such a plan. Key reforms should include creating an objective fiscal assessment body at arm’s-length from the policy-making process and a stronger legal foundation for medium and long-term fiscal targets.</p>

Reform should broaden direct tax bases while lowering tax rates on corporate income. The consumption tax, which has a less negative impact on growth than other types of taxes, should be the main source of additional revenue. Environmental taxes also have a role to play, including in helping to promote green growth.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The recovery has stalled as confidence has weakened and financial conditions have deteriorated as a result of the sovereign debt crisis. The momentum in domestic demand has waned and external demand is slowing sharply. Fiscal consolidation and adjustment of private sector balance sheets will continue to restrain demand growth. Unemployment will begin to rise again and there will be a wide margin of spare capacity. Inflation will fall, against the background of weak underlying price pressures. The announcement of the measures agreed at the October Euro Summit failed to restore confidence and needs to be followed up by swift mobilisation of adequate financial resources to ease contagion. To enhance fiscal credibility, euro countries should pursue consolidation plans set out in their Stability Programmes, while further monetary loosening is needed to help support activity. Provided that policy actions are sufficient to restore confidence gradually, activity should pick up somewhat from mid-2012. The main risks centre on the interactions of slow growth, sovereign debt and weaknesses in the banking system, as well as the ability of policymakers to find a credible solution to the debt crisis.</emphasis>

The functioning of the interbank market has become impaired with some institutions suffering reduced access to market financing and a withdrawal of funding by US mutual funds. The ECB October Bank Lending Survey points to a renewed tightening of loan standards for businesses and households. At the same time, euro area equity markets have plunged. The crisis led to a modest depreciation in the effective euro exchange rate. Business and consumer confidence is deteriorating.</p>

Consumption growth will slow as households undertake precautionary saving, investment will be weak as projects are put on hold and financing becomes scarcer, and global weakness will hurt export growth. Recovery is anticipated to take hold from mid-2012 as confidence gradually improves among households, businesses and in the financial sector. Monetary easing will contribute to more favourable financing conditions. The recovery will be muted, however, as a result of weakened labour market conditions, the continued need to resolve underlying economic imbalances in some countries and remaining fragilities in financial conditions. On-going and necessary fiscal consolidation will be a drag on demand.</p>

Since the sovereign debt crisis intensified in August, the ECB has again extended non-standard measures. Given the slowdown in activity at a time of existing spare capacity and weak underlying inflationary pressures, policy rates should be lowered and non-standard measures continued as planned with the aim of reducing the overnight interbank rate to a very low level.

          <emphasis emph="bold">The economy is facing a period of weakness reflecting a worldwide loss of confidence and lower world trade growth, which usually hits Germany more than others through weaker exports and investment. Economic activity is expected to recover gradually during 2012 as uncertainty declines and trade picks up. Growth rates may then rise above potential from around mid-2012, given the absence of underlying imbalances in household and corporate balance sheets and only moderate fiscal consolidation needs. Unemployment is projected to remain close to historically low levels, supporting consumer confidence. The fiscal situation improved rapidly due to both structural and cyclical factors and, so long as the weakening of growth is temporary, it is unlikely to derail this improvement.</emphasis>

It has been hit by a marked deterioration of world trade and by a rapid loss in confidence related to the sovereign debt crisis in some euro area countries. As a result, the contribution to growth from exports is likely to fall given Germany’s significant exposure to foreign trade, notably to international demand for investment goods. In addition, domestic firms are likely to be more hesitant to invest over the coming quarters as signalled by decreasing business confidence indicators. Weaker confidence and substantial losses in equity markets may also lead households to raise their savings rate, which may weigh on consumption and partly offset an increase in disposable income.</p>

To some extent this reflects the beneficial effect of past labour market reforms which lowered structural unemployment. With slower growth envisaged for 2012, the decline in unemployment is projected to reverse somewhat. However, the increased flexibility of working hours at the company level – which was demonstrated forcefully in the past recession – will damp the adverse effects if companies believe that the slowdown is short lived and respond accordingly with renewed labour hoarding.</p>

This is due to both the favourable cyclical situation up to now and improvements in the structural balance. Over the projection horizon the government is expected to continue implementing its planned consolidation measures, which amount to around 0.3% of GDP per year, in accordance with the fiscal rule that requires a structural deficit at the federal level of at most 0.35% of GDP by 2016. The forecast is for an almost unchanged budget deficit in 2012 as the cyclical deterioration offsets most of the improvements underlying consolidation. With an improved growth outlook in 2013 the deficit is set to continue declining.</p>

This reflects a projected improvement of world trade and hence strengthening exports. Confidence is also expected to gradually rise, thus leading to a pick-up in investment spending. Financial conditions remain very easy and there are pent-up investment opportunities. Consumer spending will also benefit as the rise in the household saving rate may be reversed and disposable income improves on the back of wage increases. The recovery from the period of weak growth is envisaged to continue through 2013 and is likely to be stronger than in other euro area countries because in Germany there is no need for deleveraging in either the household or corporate sectors. However, despite this recovery the output gap is expected to remain negative, thereby damping inflationary pressures and leading to a fall in annual headline inflation to around 1½ per cent by 2013.</p>

There are some early signs that the housing market has turned downwards, and factors that helped to limit the house-price adjustment in 2008-09, such as declining mortgage rates, public support and low indebtedness, are now playing a much smaller role. In addition, the large exposure of the French banking system to countries at the core of market tensions has become a source of increasing uncertainty, contributing to the sharp rise in the government bond yield spread<emphasis emph="italic"> vis-à-vis </emphasis>Germany. With contagion having spread to France, higher borrowing costs will affect the whole economy.</p>

As a result, the government is commited to reducing the general government deficit from 5.7% of GDP in 2011 to 4.5% in 2012 and 3% in 2013. The projection herein assumes that these objectives will be met. Given slow economic growth and the increased cost of debt, reaching the 2012 target will require additional consolidation measures, of the order of 0.4% of GDP. To preserve credibility, the fiscal framework needs to be strengthened.</p>

Extending the General Public Policy Review to all levels of public administration and shrinking programmes that are not cost effective will be key. Consolidation of small municipalities and elimination of departments could generate substantial economies of scale. Considerable savings could also be made without impairing the quality of the health-care system by reducing the frequency and length of hospital stays, lowering administrative costs, eliminating reimbursement of the least effective drugs, expanding the use of generics and implementing capitation-based physician compensation.</p>

Private investment is likely to be affected by the deterioration in companies’ self-financing ratio, while poor employments prospects will weigh on private consumption. Fiscal consolidation will prevent a narrowing of the output gap, but its impact will be limited by the design of the measures announced so far and partly offset by an accommodative euro-area-wide monetary policy, and a decline in the household saving rate from the current abnormally high level. The unemployment rate is likely to resume its upward trend and peak at about 10.4%, and headline inflation decline to near 1%.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Italy’s economic recovery has lost momentum. Output is set to decline well into 2012, and thereafter the recovery is projected to be weak. Confronted with adverse market sentiment, the previous government adopted emergency measures to balance the budget in 2013. The newly-appointed government needs to fully implement this programme as well as undertake important structural reforms to spur growth. Fiscal tightening, combined with slowing world demand and weak competitiveness, will be a drag on growth in the short term, but it is needed to ensure progress toward fiscal sustainability. Unemployment will rise and wage growth will moderate, as will inflation after the impact of a VAT rise has worked through.</emphasis>

Credit conditions have been tightening, more due to banks’ difficulties in accessing external finance than to heightened perception of lending risk, though this has risen too. The trade deficit remains quite high given the depressed level of demand in Italy, a sign of poor cost competitiveness. Unemployment has been falling slightly even though the number of people benefitting from the short-time working income-support scheme has fallen to 0.8% of total employment. Despite weak demand growth underlying inflation has been rising.</p>

Its commitment to structural reform, despite publication of a National Reform Plan in the spring of 2010, also seemed in doubt. The consequent steep rise in interest rates on government debt then forced the government to adopt an even tighter fiscal stance, aiming to eliminate the deficit by 2013.</p>

This is partly because Italy is exposed to the same forces as other European economies, deteriorating confidence, weak export market growth and difficult financial conditions. As this outlook is well below that assumed in the 2012 budget, further measures will be required (and are included in these projections) to keep the fiscal adjustment programme on track. Export growth should recover somewhat in 2013 with a revival in world trade, and if confidence returns investment may pick up too. But government expenditure will continue to decline and low disposable income growth will mean low private consumption.</p>

Fiscal actions need to be introduced as needed to eliminate the deficit by 2013 and put the debt ratio on a declining trajectory. In the event of still greater weakness in activity, there will be little choice but to introduce further tightening measures to keep fiscal policy on track. Spending restraint rather than taxation should form the backbone of longer-term consolidation and further tax amnesties would be counterproductive.</p>

The council should publish an assessment of macroeconomic outlook and implementation of fiscal targets at regular intervals.</p>

Wage moderation is imperative to reverse the long increase in relative unit labour costs. A stronger lead from the public sector, with cuts in nominal wages and regional differentiation, would be a good signal.</p>

Privatisation of local public services, and establishing an independent regulator, would increase efficiency. National level privatisation could also improve competition and provide some debt-reducing revenue. A level playing field for foreign investors, including in financial institutions, should be ensured.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Weak international demand, continued retrenchment among households and needed fiscal consolidation has halted the recovery. Growth will start to pick up during 2012 as exports and household consumption recover, with further strengthening in 2013. Unemployment is rising and will reach 9% in 2013, while inflation is presently peaking as anticipated and is expected to fall below the 2% target in 2013 as temporary effects from VAT hikes and commodity prices wane. Monetary policy is supportive, with the Bank rate at 0.5% and quantitative easing being resumed. Further expansions of quantitative measures are warranted. The ambitious fiscal consolidation has bolstered credibility and helped maintain low bond yields, leaving room for automatic stabilisers to work fully to cushion the slowdown.</emphasis>

Further headwinds come from a weakening global economy, lower asset prices and rising uncertainty related to the euro area debt crisis. With household consumption falling, government spending shrinking and export growth slowing, the economy is weakening. Continued fiscal retrenchment will remain a drag over the coming years, but slowing inflation and gradually recovering export demand from 2012 will shore up consumption and exports and support an initially weak recovery. As consumer confidence improves and real incomes start to rise, consumption growth will gain strength over 2012. In 2013, rising business confidence and increasing capacity utilisation will support business investment, quickening the recovery.</p>

Government employment will continue to fall, while the business sector will further decrease hiring in response to flagging demand. The weakening of the economy is likely to have a proportionally bigger impact on employment than in the recent recession, as real wages and shorter working hours may adjust less this time. Unemployment is set to pick up through 2012 before stabilising around 9% in 2013. To mitigate the consequences of rising unemployment, especially among youth, resources for labour market training are warranted.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s07-04-p0125" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">With the Bank rate at 0.5% and quantitative easing (QE) recently expanded to 18% of GDP (£275 billion), monetary policy is highly expansionary. Even so, more support is needed urgently as headwinds are strong. The projection assumes that the Bank of England increases QE further to a total of £400 billion by early 2012, leaving the Bank with almost 40% of the total stock of outstanding government bonds. Given ongoing weakness in lending to small firms, targeted measures, as currently discussed by the government, could be useful.</p>

The fiscal deficit is estimated to fall to 9% of GDP in 2011, still twice the EU average and higher than other G7 countries, apart from the United States and Japan. In 2013 gross government debt is expected to be close to 100% of GDP. Hence, planned fiscal consolidation tightening needs to continue despite the significantly weakening economic outlook, and this is assumed in the projection. The underlying primary balance will improve by about 1.3% of GDP per year between 2010 and 2013. In line with the fiscal plans and targets, the automatic stabilisers are assumed to be left to work fully.</p>

Investment may contract more than forecast due to high uncertainty, weak corporate cash flows and tightening financial conditions. The materialisation of international risks, and their potential repercussions on the banking sector and overall confidence, would weaken both domestic demand and exports. Household consumption may fall more than expected as uncertainty, weaker balance sheets and rising unemployment trigger higher precautionary savings. At the same time, more persistent inflation could further squeeze incomes. On the positive side, a robust resolution of the euro area crisis could boost confidence and support a stronger recovery.</p>

However, credibility will demand that the medium-term fiscal targets be retained and achieved, implying greater tightening later on. The measures to implement this future compensating tightening should be announced upfront. Possibilities include ending exemptions and abolishing lowered VAT rates in 2013, or increasing the state pension age. Such a package would improve both short and long-term growth prospects.</p>

Effective measures to combat fast-rising homelessness should be implemented.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The outlook for the Canadian economy has weakened significantly, mainly because of a deteriorating external environment. Heightened risks from renewed financial-market turmoil linked to the European sovereign debt crisis and high levels of household indebtedness are eroding consumer confidence. While business investment continues to expand robustly, weaker prospects for the global economy and persistent strength of the exchange rate are projected to restrain export performance, tempering the speed of economic growth. Underlying inflation will remain subdued due to continued significant economic slack.</emphasis>

Real GDP declined slightly in the second quarter of 2011, undermined by a significant drag from external trade. The weakness was compounded by transitory factors hampering oil and gas extraction, as well as manufacturing supply-chain disruptions caused by the Fukushima disaster, which have reversed in the third quarter. Meanwhile, domestic demand has held relatively firm, led by private non-residential investment, as business credit has expanded robustly. Residential investment also posted solid gains in the first half of 2011, and more recent indicators point to continued buoyancy in housing markets over the near term. However, the unemployment rate has hovered at around 7.3% in the second half of the year, with some recent trimming of private-sector jobs.</p>

Consumer confidence has deteriorated since the beginning of the year, and equity prices have trended down for the past six months, generating a dip in household wealth. Although food and energy price moderation should provide some relief to real household incomes, debt levels remain at a record 150% of disposable income. Consumers have therefore pared back borrowing to its slowest pace since the early 1990s. House prices remain at historically high levels relative to incomes and rents, and some cooling of housing demand is expected, given the tightening of mortgage insurance regulations that took effect in March and April 2011. The sound financial position of the corporate sector and a low cost of capital should continue to sustain strong growth in business investment.</p>

The projection assumes that expenditure cuts are implemented as budgeted, with the total government deficit narrowing to 3% of GDP in 2013.</p>

Employment could be boosted by implementing stronger measures to integrate immigrants into the labour market and facilitate inter-provincial labour mobility, including by removing remaining barriers to inter-provincial trade in professional services</p>

Vigorous investment and exports, buoyed by the mining boom, along with the positive income effect of high terms of trade, should offset the negative impact on activity of a persistently strong exchange rate and fiscal consolidation. Unemployment is expected to stay low and underlying inflation contained as the remaining slack in the economy gradually disappears.</emphasis>

However, the rising exchange rate has subdued growth in the non-mining trade-exposed sectors. The unemployment rate remains close to its structural level. Underlying inflation, which has been decreasing since 2008, fell below 2½ per cent in the third quarter of 2011.</p>

This more neutral monetary stance will help offset the depressing effect of the persistent downside risks surrounding the global economy on the equity market. Despite the decline in long-term interest rates since the third quarter of 2011, financial conditions have remained relatively tight because of the strength of the Australian dollar, which has averaged 7% higher in 2011 than in 2010 in real effective terms.</p>

Stringent spending control, consistent with the government’s plans, is still necessary to offset the revenue declines induced by the financial crisis and natural disasters. The authorities have reaffirmed their objective of returning to surplus by FY 2012-13, to restore room for manoeuvre. This strategy should not be affected by the introduction of a fiscally neutral carbon tax in July 2012.</p>

With the gradual reduction of the output gap, inflation should stabilise at around 2½ per cent, if one excludes the temporary increase – estimated at approximately 0.7 percentage point – due to the introduction of the carbon tax as from mid-2012.</p>

The general slowdown in global growth and, in particular, the intensification of the European debt crisis since mid-year has reduced external demand from Austria’s most important trading partners. Heightened uncertainty and loss of confidence associated with the debt crisis has in addition weighed on domestic investment growth as firms delay investment decisions. This has led to a significant slowdown of output growth in the second half of 2011 and will continue to do so into the first half of 2012. As uncertainty is reduced and confidence returns, activity is projected to pick up in the second half of 2012 and into 2013 as the growth of both exports and investment resumes. </p>

With many crisis measures, such as the short-term working scheme, still in place, the weakening activity is projected to have only a limited effect on unemployment. Inflation increased sharply and is expected to be above 3% this year on the back of increased global food and energy prices as well as excise tax hikes. Higher inflation has reduced household real income and consumption growth. With commodity and food price increases abating and rising spare capacity, inflation is projected to slow. This, in conjunction with a robust labour market, will support continued moderate consumption growth going forward.</p>

The government recently announced plans to introduce a debt brake which envisages a structural deficit of 0.35% of GDP for the central government and a balanced budget for sub-central government levels from 2017 onwards. Swift implementation of this reform should foster confidence in the medium-term sustainability of public finances.</p>

A particular risk for the outlook also concerns the exposure of Austrian banks to countries outside the euro area in central-eastern and south-east Europe. If the economic outlook for these countries weakens significantly, this might cause additional stress for the Austrian banking system with repercussions on the real economy through the credit channel. The government should thus consider how the necessary additional capital requirements for the Austrian banks, in line with the new regulation concerning lending put in place by the financial regulator, can be obtained without undercutting their lending capacity.</p>

Employment growth, which had been relatively strong earlier in the year, has also slowed sharply. Inflation has come down somewhat since peaking at 3.8% (y-o-y) at mid-year, reflecting the waning effects of earlier energy price increases, but underlying inflation has remained around 1¾ per cent (y-o-y). Despite the agreed low real wage increases in 2011 and 2012, the automatic wage indexation will translate past price increases into higher nominal wages, eroding external cost competitiveness.</p>

The 2011 budget stipulates fiscal tightening of about ½ per cent of GDP, through a number of small measures. As revenues and spending are slowing together, the government’s objective of a budget deficit of 3.6% of GDP should be achieved. At the time of writing, the 2012 Budget proposal had not been presented. In line with the Stability Programme, an improvement of the structural fiscal balance per year of 1% of GDP is assumed over the projection period, technically implemented with equal weights on the spending and revenue side. Based on these assumptions, the deficit will fall by close to ½ per cent of GDP in 2012 and about 1% of GDP in 2013.</p>

Although the terms of trade remain favourable, the current account has moved into deficit, as imports are growing fast and the growth of both mining and industrial exports has slowed down considerably, reflecting global conditions. The peso appreciated strongly during the first half of 2011, but has depreciated since mid-September amid worsening international developments and declining copper prices. Confidence measures and advanced indicators both point to a slowdown.</p>

The central bank has left the policy rate at 5.25% since July, close to its estimated neutral level. Monetary policy is expected to ease somewhat in early 2012, because of the signs of slowdown and the external uncertainty. With a slowing economy and inflation well within the target range, there is room for monetary loosening if a worsening of the global economy makes it necessary.</p>

Once reconstruction winds down and the external environment improves, the government should eliminate the structural deficit and rebuild buffers in the copper fund, which has proved useful in weathering past shocks.</p>

Inflation is projected to remain well within the target range of 3% (+/–1) until the end of the projection period.</p>

Economic activity has been supported primarily by foreign trade and investment, while consumption, both private and in the public sector, has constituted a drag. Nonetheless, the labour market situation has improved, but the unemployment rate continues to fall only very gradually. Recent monthly indicators point to continued weak growth. Also, confidence among business and consumers has been declining. Economic growth will be subdued next year as exports are likely to weaken and fiscal consolidation will weigh further on domestic demand. With external conditions improving through 2012, the economy will again gather momentum.</p>

The exchange rate remains strong, helping to restrain price increases. Headline inflation will increase temporarily next year, as a result of a scheduled hike in the preferential VAT rate, but should decline again in 2013, a pattern consistent with market inflation expectations. The main refinancing rate should stay at its historical low until the last quarter of 2012 when the economy picks up more strongly. However, given the increasingly uncertain outlook, the authorities are rightly prepared to move the rate in either direction.</p>

The draft budget for 2012 includes a number of revenue measures, in particular the increase in the preferential VAT rate from 10% to 14%, a first step in unification of the rates in 2013. Part of the extra revenues should be used to cover the expected shortfall in pension contributions resulting from the introduction of a voluntary carve-out of the public defined-benefit tier. Furthermore, efficiency savings in public procurement and across ministries are planned. However, some reforms may complicate meeting deficit targets in 2013 and the authorities are considering a possibility of postponing them.</p>

On the domestic side, one risk is that consumption could be weaker as a result of worse-than-expected labour market performance and a further housing market deterioration. In response, highly indebted Danish households, whose net wealth depends mostly on home equity and pension wealth, could step up saving. More expensive loans to the corporate sector by banks facing funding pressures and further deterioriation in global conditions would curtail investment.</p>

The economy should continue to grow throughout the projection period, benefiting from unit labour cost reductions in the crisis and recent investments in export-oriented manufacturing. Real GDP growth is projected to be less than 4% in 2011 but to pick up again as external conditions improve in the second half of 2012.</p>

Despite inflationary persistence, externally driven price pressures are likely to subside. Wages continue to fall in real terms, but high nominal wage growth might lead to the emergence of domestic sources of inflation. Electricity price increases will have a temporary impact in inflation in 2013.</p>

Total public debt will remain below 7% of GDP in 2011, and government net assets are positive. The underlying fiscal position will remain close to balance during the projection period, notwithstanding a temporary deterioration of the headline fiscal balance in 2012 due to the phasing out of one-off measures and large government investment obligations linked to the previous sales of Kyoto emission permits. The investment will provide a substantial stimulus to the economy as other sources of growth fade. As growth slows the automatic stabilisers should also be allowed to work.</p>

However, access to financing for households and firms might become more difficult if the turmoil in world financial markets intensifies, despite the solidity of the Finnish banking system, which holds large amounts of high-quality capital and very low exposure to risky foreign assets. The 2012 budget implies a mild fiscal contraction in 2012 and 2013. Given the medium-term need for consolidation and the fact that automatic stabilisers are allowed to work outside the expenditure ceiling, this stance looks appropriate.</p>

Automatic stabilisers should therefore be allowed to work if the economy weakens and further support would be warranted in the form of temporary and targeted fiscal stimulus. Nevertheless, as a rapidly ageing population is pushing spending up, medium-term fiscal consolidation would have to be re-established.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The economy fell deeper into recession in 2011 despite a rebound in exports, as sizable, but necessary, fiscal adjustment continued, domestic demand plunged and unemployment rose sharply. After contracting further in 2012, output is projected to begin to rise in 2013 led by wide-ranging structural reforms, strengthened external demand, improved competitiveness and higher investment. Substantial economic slack and high unemployment will push inflation to very low levels. To enhance credibility and ensure public debt begins to fall durably, fiscal consolidation must continue and structural reforms be implemented as envisaged. Risks to the outlook are substantial and remain skewed to the downside.</emphasis>

However, exports rebounded on the back of strong tourism and gradually improving competitiveness. The unemployment rate has risen rapidly to the highest in the OECD, after Spain. Inflationary pressures have eased as domestic demand weakened further, with headline inflation corrected for tax changes remaining significantly below the euro area average.</p>

The government’s deficit target will be missed owing to the deeper than expected recession and slow implementation of some critical structural fiscal reforms. The 2012 draft Budget aims at a revised deficit target of 9% of GDP in 2011 and 5.4% of GDP for 2012 taking into account the October 26, 2011 package agreed at the European level, including the 50% write-down of privately-held public debt. The draft budget, which incorporates commitments agreed with the IMF and the EU, foresees a primary surplus for first time after many years. The OECD projection is for a deficit of 9% of GDP in 2011 and 7% of GDP in 2012, declining to 5¼ per cent of GDP in 2013. This implies that the debt-GDP ratio will continue to rise. However, this projection is based on a weaker growth assumption and excludes debt write-down measures in the October package for lack of specific information on the details. Implementation of the October agreement, continued fiscal adjustment and reforms to make the economy more competitive are therefore needed for more favourable debt dynamics. OECD preliminary estimates suggest that the implementation of the private sector involvement (50% haircut and bank recapitalisation) entailed in the October agreement could reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by around 35%, allowing the debt to fall close to 120% of GDP by 2020 if the adjustment programme remains on track.</p>

Inflation is set to fall to zero in the projection period in view of the substantial degree of economic slack and high unemployment. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to around 5½ per cent of GDP in 2013.</p>

But despite a large degree of slack in the economy, tensions in financial markets constrain the monetary authorities’ scope to reduce interest rates. A unilateral decision to allow borrowers to repay foreign currency loans at an off-market exchange rate has further undermined confidence and should be scrapped as it may precipitate a credit crunch. This projection assumes an interest rate cut of only 50 basis points to 5.5% by end-2012 and an unchanged rate in 2013.</p>

As a result, despite an expected fiscal surplus in 2011, the government balance is projected to return to a deficit in 2012 and 2013. Fiscal consolidation, preferably supported by an agreement with multilateral organisations, is urgently needed to establish credibility with the markets. Without such agreement there is little choice but to meet announced fiscal targets. The fiscal consolidation plan, which aims to achieve a headline deficit target of 2.5% of GDP in 2012, is mainly based on increases in healthcare contributions, various excise taxes and the VAT rate from 25% to 27%. Spending measures have been less well defined, calling into question the actual implementation of the planned adjustment in 2012 and 2013.</p>

A recovery should start in the latter half of 2012 as the effect of these factors diminishes. The unemployment rate is projected to increase notably with advances in labour force participation spurred by cuts in the generosity of social benefits, and employment losses partly reflecting a programmed large hike in the minimum wage in 2012. A recent elimination of the job-search benefit could reduce labour mobility and increase mismatches in the labour market.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">After successful completion of its IMF-supported adjustment programme, Iceland has returned to economic growth in 2011, despite the euro area turmoil. Growth is led by large energy-intensive investment projects, residential construction and private consumption expenditure, which will be spurred by high recent collective wage agreements. The unemployment rate has started to fall from high levels by Icelandic standards and should continue to decline with the pick-up of economic activity. While Iceland has made considerable progress in putting its public finances on a sustainable path, further consolidation is required, albeit less than in the countries affected by the sovereign debt crisis.</emphasis>

The recovery has been led by strengthening private consumption and investment expenditure. Residential construction has soared as work on incomplete housing projects has been resumed. The unemployment rate has fallen from the peak late last year, but remained high at 6.6% (seasonally adjusted) in the third quarter. Large collective wage increases and rising commodity prices have pushed up inflation, although it remains well below the increase in disposable income.</p>

Further budget consolidation amounting to around 1½ to 2 percentage points of GDP per year is planned in 2012-13, yielding rising primary surpluses from 2012 onwards. On the basis of these plans, general government gross debt (including civil service pension liabilities of 20% of GDP) should peak at 128% of GDP in 2012, and net debt at 51% of GDP. The authorities aim to reduce gross debt to 60% of GDP in the long term, including through asset sales.</p>

The main banks appear to be well capitalised. The government completed a US dollar bond issue over the summer at 320 basis points over inter-bank rates, demonstrating its ability to borrow in international capital markets and thereby fulfilling one of the conditions for lifting capital controls. The government is also advancing on other elements of the strategy to lift capital controls, although this is unlikely to occur by 2013. To contain inflation, policy interest rates were increased by 0.25 percentage point in both August and November to 4.5% currently. Further withdrawal of monetary accommodation is in prospect.</p>

Inflation is projected to fall towards the authorities’ target (2½ per cent) as the temporary factors that recently boosted it pass and economic slack continues to weigh on price setters.</p>

For 2012 and 2013 it is assumed the government fully implements the consolidation measures announced in the recently published Medium-Term Fiscal Statement. Interest payment reductions of around 0.5% of GDP in 2012 and 0.7% of GDP in 2013 due to interest rate cuts on finance provided by the EU are assumed to be used to narrow the fiscal deficit.

However, risks to this projection are skewed to the downside. Rebalancing of the economy is underway but deleveraging continues and Ireland remains highly reliant on, and vulnerable to changes in, foreign demand. Debt reduction may exert a stronger drag on domestic demand than incorporated in this projection, especially if employment growth does not resume as anticipated. In addition, the banks must carry out a fine balancing act of selling assets and reducing in size while still maintaining new lending to support the recovery in a very difficult international financial environment.</p>

Exports shrank sharply in the third quarter of 2011, inflation is easing, and the housing market has cooled off somewhat. Also, bond-market indicators show a fall in inflation expectations towards the centre of the target band (1 to 3% increase in consumer prices) for the year ahead. The policy interest rate was reduced to 3% in October. This has contributed to significant depreciation of the shekel against the dollar; the Bank of Israel has not made any foreign-currency interventions since July.</p>

The projection assumes two further cuts in the policy rate, which should help to bring about some renewed pick-up in activity next spring. During 2013 a resumption of interest-rate normalisation would be appropriate, as real output growth is projected to expand by nearly 4% for the year as a whole. A modest rise in the unemployment rate is projected for the coming quarters, and consumer-price inflation may fall back to the middle of the target band. The budget deficit is projected to be close to target in 2011 (with a reduction of 1.0 percentage point of GDP) but may well overshoot in 2012 (with only a 0.2 percentage-point reduction).</p>

More moderate growth is helping to bring inflation back into the central bank’s target range of 2 to 4%.

Although Korea has a current account surplus, estimated at almost 2% of GDP in 2011, the won remains relatively volatile, particularly during periods of global financial turbulence. Once the economy has overcome the current soft patch and high uncertainty, further policy interest rate hikes will be needed to contain inflation.</p>

Korean exports will be sustained by strong demand from China, its largest trading partner, and by the relatively low level of the won. Stronger exports should prompt a recovery in fixed investment and a pick-up in private consumption, boosting output growth to more than 4% in 2013.</p>

Household debt has continued to increase, reaching 132% of household income in 2010. Rising interest rates could thus have a larger than expected damping effect on private consumption. On the external side, with exports accounting for more than half of GDP, Korea is particularly vulnerable to a sharp deterioration in the world economy.</p>

          <p id="o12-2011-02-1-P00-c01-s24-04-p0363" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Mexico has maintained a sound fiscal position, thanks to an early move towards consolidation in 2010 and a stabilisation of oil revenues for now. Given considerable uncertainties regarding the health of the world economy the government has decided to delay the return to a balanced budget by one year. The public sector net borrowing requirement is expected now to fall from 4% of GDP in 2009 to 2% in 2013. This translates into a balanced budget, based on the government’s definition of the deficit that excludes the national oil company’s investment, but includes a number of pure financing operations. However, in the long run Mexico will need further tax reform to reduce dependence on oil-related revenues and a further cut in energy subsidies to meet important spending needs for education and social policies. The government should also work to accumulate larger buffers in its oil stabilisation funds. The establishment of an independent fiscal council would enhance the credibility of Mexico’s fiscal framework, as would the publication of the budget and debt data in line with internationally accepted standards.</p>

Financial turmoil affected confidence and a combination of falling equity prices and low interest rates dragged pension funds’ average coverage ratio below official requirements. Unless coverage ratios recover, this points to lower future pensions. Headline inflation has risen, as in the rest of Europe, on the back of higher energy prices. Core inflation has also picked up, but wage growth remained stable. Harmonised unemployment, which had been declining since mid-2010, started rising again over the summer, although at 4½ per cent it remains among the lowest in Europe.</p>

In 2013, the government foresees a further reduction in the budget deficit of ½ per cent of GDP as part of its medium-term fiscal plan.</p>

Reconstruction from the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, delayed thus far by aftershocks, should soon gain momentum and continue for a number of years. Incomes will benefit from still high prices for export commodities, in particular dairy products, despite some recent weakening. The recovery in household spending will be restrained by deleveraging, however, especially in light of falling wealth due mainly to house-price weakness. This will be only partly offset by rising employment and low mortgage rates. Business investment will be held back by continuing economic uncertainty and, perhaps, weakened credit supply. In the near term, net exports will be impaired by ongoing impacts of labour cost competitiveness losses.</p>

Nevertheless, monetary conditions have tightened through rising risk margins, intensified bank competition for domestic deposits and, until lately, exchange-rate appreciation. With core inflation and inflation expectations still above the mid-point of the Reserve Bank’s 1-3% inflation target band, the room for interest rate cuts may be limited. Capacity constraints in the form of skilled labour shortages and wage pressures are already apparent, most notably in the construction sector, and could intensify as rebuilding takes off in 2012. The Official Cash Rate should start to be raised in the first half of 2012.</p>

The economy will subsequently resume its robust expansion as confidence returns. Consumer price inflation has remained low, reflecting moderate rises in unit labour costs and import prices, but the acceleration of output will lift it somewhat by the end of the projection period. The unemployment rate is likely to remain stable, as increasing labour demand will be met by continued high net immigration.</emphasis>

Interest rates abroad are likely to remain very low in the near to medium term, limiting the scope for Norges Bank to raise rates without causing an appreciation of the already strong krone. Given weaker prospects for the world economy, Norges Bank has appropriately maintained a supportive monetary stance. In the current environment, Norges Bank should keep its policy rate stable through the end of 2012 and resume the tightening cycle in early 2013. Signs of imbalances in asset markets, particularly very high house prices and household debt, should be addressed by tightening mortgage lending regulation and unwinding the extraordinary tax advantages favouring housing investment.</p>

Rising domestic demand will spur employment growth, although continued high net immigration will keep wage growth at modest levels. The planned one percentage point hike in the value-added tax on food will cause headline inflation to rise temporarily above core inflation.</p>

Considering Poland’s limited fiscal space, lower-than-expected economic growth could turn fiscal policy even more pro-cyclical if public debt (on a national definition) goes beyond the threshold of 55%. However, the central bank is in a position to cut its policy rate in such a case. Yet, the risks of rising unemployment and a large currency depreciation triggered by capital outflows might have serious effects on the banking sector.</p>

Furthermore, long-standing fragilities in the fiscal framework were again exposed by a recent revision of the 2010 deficit to 9.8% of GDP (from 9.2%), mainly due to previously unrecorded expenditure by the Madeira regional administration (incurred over several years) and, to a smaller extent, to health care spending. To meet the EU/IMF financial assistance programme budget targets, the authorities announced in the summer and in the draft 2012 Budget additional measures for 2011 and 2012, respectively. The former, mostly of a temporary nature, include a personal income tax surcharge (mainly falling on the extra month of salary or pension paid at Christmas), the transfer of banking sector pension funds to the state and bringing forward higher VAT on electricity and gas. Most of the additional savings in 2012 are expected to come from suppressing the two extra monthly payments for civil servants and pensioners (with no or smaller cuts for those earning less than 1000 euros per month), as well as from a broader scope of the VAT standard rate. The projections incorporate these announcements. To sustain the consolidation effort over the medium term, structural reforms in public administration must be carried out to increase its efficiency and the ability to attract high-skilled staff.</p>

In addition, conditions on the sovereign bond market have deteriorated significantly over the past few months. The government has thus rightly planned ambitious consolidation measures to reach its deficit target of 2.9% of GDP in 2013, with efforts appropriately concentrated on the expenditure side. However, without further measures to offset the cyclical deterioration of revenues and higher spending, the consolidation pace is projected to slow, leaving a deficit of 3.5% of GDP in 2013.</p>

Consumption is expected to contribute positively to growth following some improvement in the labour market, notably as the recent reforms of the labour code, which relaxed employment protection legislation somewhat, will foster employment. Finally, real household income will benefit from lower inflation, not least because increases in regulated prices should be less pronounced going forward.</p>

In the first pillar, the replacement rate should be adjusted by adding a sustainability factor in the pension formula.

Finally, institutions like legal extension of collective wage agreements or the minimum wage should not be allowed to prevent wages from adjusting to local market conditions.</p>

Real GDP growth is projected to remain weak in 2012 amid sluggish domestic demand and a lack of support from exports. Employment is projected to fall until the fourth quarter of 2012, when the unemployment rate is expected to peak. Activity is projected to pick up again in late 2012, which will bring down unemployment in 2013. As economic slack is set to remain substantial, inflation pressures will remain subdued.</p>

This is expected to reduce the budget deficit to around 3% of GDP by 2013. In September 2011, the government adopted a supplementary budget to address shortfalls in reaching the 2011 target, most notably due to weak macroeconomic outturns, the re-capitalisation of systemic banks and support to the state railway and airline companies. The fiscal outlook for 2012 is, however, uncertain, in large part owing to political uncertainty. Parliament is not expected to discuss any major fiscal legislation until a new government is elected in December 2011.</p>

Slovenian banks remain among the most thinly capitalised in the euro area and further capital injections would put additional pressure on public finances. Coupled with the increasingly uncertain political situation and implementation risks of fiscal consolidation plans, some rating agencies have recently downgraded Slovenia’s sovereign rating. Continuing deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and the quality of bank assets also led to rating downgrades of several Slovenian banks, increasing the funding costs and difficulties faced by the banks on international markets. Reflecting heightened concerns about the state of public finances, government bond yields rose to 7% in mid-November.</p>

In 2011, these include accelerated tax payments by large corporations (0.3% of GDP) and spending cuts on the military, pharmaceuticals and subsidies (0.5% of GDP). The projections incorporate the budgetary adjustments that regional governments have agreed with the central government in order to meet limits on their deficits. These include cuts in investment, subsidy and wage spending as well as revenue-raising measures. In 2012, the introduction of a wealth tax and lower pharmaceuticals spending will reduce the government deficit by 0.4% of GDP. All levels of government will continue reducing public employment. In order to reach budgetary targets in 2012 and 2013, they are assumed to reduce investment, subsidy and other transfer spending further. A legal limit on public spending growth of the central government and large municipalities, determined by trend economic growth, has been introduced. Regional governments have committed to adopting similar rules. A requirement to limit public deficits and debt, in line with European Union rules, has been introduced in the constitution. Specific structural deficit limits applying to each level of government from 2020 will be fixed by law. Comprehensive stress tests have strengthened transparency on the banks’ capacity to absorb losses. All the major banks have met the requirement to hold core capital of at least 8 or 10% of risk-weighted assets, mostly with private sector injections. The 5 largest banks are expected to meet the stricter capital requirements of the European Banking Authority largely with retained earnings and convertible bonds already issued.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Sweden enjoyed a very strong recovery through mid-2011, but is now being hit by the ongoing global economic slowdown. The pace of job creation is set to slow and the decline in unemployment to pause. Private consumption, which has been one of the main drivers of growth, should moderate. As world trade regains strength from mid-2012, Sweden’s economic momentum is projected to pick up. Spare capacity will increase in the near term, hence core inflation should stay subdued.</emphasis>

As the external economic environment deteriorated, the government put off some of the growth-friendly tax cuts it had contemplated earlier on, so as to build up a larger fiscal margin. The government is nonetheless pressing ahead with a permanent cut in the VAT rate for restaurant and catering services. It has also announced extra public investment (notably in road and railway maintenance) and an extension of active labour market policies.</p>

Slower export growth and eroded confidence will weaken investment and GDP growth. Employment growth is likely to be subdued in 2012 and the unemployment rate could inch up again in 2012. With a deteriorating labour market and an increasing risk of house price declines in the near future, household saving will remain high, weakening consumption growth. Activity is projected to regain some momentum into 2013, however, as world trade picks up, allowing the unemployment rate to fall.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Very strong growth in early 2011, driven by private consumption and investment, has been curbed by credit containment policies and deteriorating global conditions. As a result, real GDP growth is projected to slow to 3% in 2012. It is set to recover in 2013 as the external environment improves. The sharp exchange rate depreciation in 2011 should gradually help rebalance domestic and external demand and narrow the large current account deficit, which by mid-2011 approached 10% of GDP. On the other hand, it may also put upward pressure on already high inflation.</emphasis>

Against this backdrop, inflation rose and the current account deficit approached unprecedented levels of around 10% of GDP. Significant real exchange rate depreciation since early 2011 has helped slow import penetration but exports have been weakened by the slowdown in global and European demand. Policies to reduce high credit growth have successfully restrained demand.</p>

The monetary authorities’ recourse to non-traditional policy tools for cooling domestic demand (notably household credit growth targets and curbs on the use of credit cards) and the depreciation helped to rebalance demand as intended. However, inflation rose, reflecting rising commodity prices and exchange rate pass-through, with headline and core measures both exceeding 7% in October. Risk of further exchange rate depreciation may discourage the needed capital inflows and trigger reverse movements. For this reason the authorities announced their commitment to counter further exchange rate depreciation and intervened in the foreign exchange market.</p>

An additional improvement is expected in 2012 despite below-potential growth, as the fiscal stance is set to tighten in order to preserve hard-won fiscal credibility. To maintain confidence in the soundness of monetary policy, effective communication on the new policy goals and comprehensive and timely reporting of outcomes are important. The highly conservative financial prudential regulatory framework is also essential to maintain confidence in the current unstable international financial environment.</p>

The current account deficit is expected to stay high despite the adjustment following the earlier sharp exchange rate depreciation and policy measures. Its financing relies on volatile short-term capital inflows, though longer-term inflows have increased anew in the course of 2011. The deficit could shrink faster if the exchange rate effects turn out to be stronger than projected. However, pass-through to domestic inflation could also be larger than foreseen, calling for the monetary authorities to react.</p>

Employment costs could be significantly reduced and the benefits of growth more widely shared if official minimum wages were regionally differentiated. Regulations concerning employment contracts should be made less rigid. The effectiveness of the temporary pro-employment schemes adopted during the crisis demonstrated that labour cost-reducing measures pay off. Labour market reform would support competitiveness and help reduce the current account deficit.</p>

Domestic demand continues to be the main engine of growth, outstripping supply and resulting in robust import growth. Private consumption has been supported by credit expansion and increasing labour incomes. Investment has gathered pace but has been growing at a much slower rate than in most of 2010. By contrast, exports have been damped by past currency appreciation and recent weakness in export markets.</p>

Assuming inflationary pressures clearly recede, there is room to lower interest rates further if the international environment continues to deteriorate.</p>

In addition, the government tightened the primary deficit target for 2011. On the current growth projection, the fiscal targets are expected to be achieved, despite the large minimum wage increase planned for 2012 and its ripple effect on pension benefits. Priority should, however, continue to be given to fiscal consolidation. In addition to putting the general government accounts onto a sustainable footing, a tighter fiscal stance would ease upward pressure on inflation and the exchange rate and make room for lower interest rates. Given the country’s needs in the short and medium term, infrastructure and social spending should continue to be protected from budget cuts. To more effectively achieve fiscal restraint, widespread revenue earmarking should be cut back and an expenditure ceiling introduced.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Growth has continued to moderate in 2011, as higher interest rates and tighter credit to the private sector slowed investment in housing and foreign trade weakened. In 2012, export growth will be held to around 7% by weak world demand and a decline in competitiveness, but the impact on activity may be partially offset by increased public spending and a cut in income taxes. Nonetheless, real GDP is set to grow below potential in 2012. Together with a fall in import prices, this should help disinflation, permitting some reduction in policy interest rates. With domestic demand and foreign trade picking up in 2013, GDP growth should recover to close to 10%. The downward trend in the current account surplus should continue, despite an improvement in the terms of trade, with the surplus falling about 2% of GDP by 2013.</emphasis>

Export growth has been sluggish. Indeed, in the three months to October exports even fell, one of the weakest out-turns since the end of the dot-com bubble in 2001 and during the 2008-09 financial crisis, confirming the ongoing re-balancing of the economy that resulted in a marked drop in the current account surplus in third quarter of the year. Domestic demand, however, has displayed resilience. Consumption growth has remained vigorous and investment growth has been holding up, after easing early in the year. Sub-par GDP growth has started to feed through into lower inflation, and there are signs that further disinflation is in store, not least in view of the recent weakening in commodity prices. With imports rising substantially, external rebalancing continued. The trade surplus has been shrinking and, associated with the appreciation of the dollar, exchange reserves have been barely rising. Nevertheless, there has been a small appreciation of the effective exchange rate since the beginning of the year. Going forward, more significant exchange rate appreciation would allow for a rebalancing of monetary conditions with lesser weight on domestic interest rates and credit conditions.</p>

New restrictions have also been put on mortgage lending and the bank regulator has forced banks to bring significant amounts of lending back onto their balance sheets. Moreover, the increase in regulated interest rates recorded so far understates the degree of financial tightness, as the PBoC has allowed market rates to increase substantially more than the administered rates. This encouraged purchases of financial market products, similar to money market funds, which offer higher rates of return than bank deposits. As a result, the larger companies increasingly use capital markets as a source of finance, with direct bank lending accounting for less than half of total credit flows in the first half of the year. However, the restrictions on off-balance sheet lending led to a marked fall in the rate of growth of total credit flows in the third quarter. Small and medium-sized businesses face more difficulty in obtaining finance. In October, the State Council announced that, to ease these problems, banks should ensure that the share of SMEs in total lending does not fall. It also increased the size of special SME financing funds.</p>

This figure, however, excludes the unofficial debt of local governments, local infrastructure companies, the Ministry of Railways and the asset management companies which were established to resolve the banking crisis of 2000. In total, such borrowing amounted to over one-third of GDP at the end of 2010. The government has announced two measures that will raise the deficit: the personal income tax threshold has been raised and the corporate tax rate for small enterprises has been lowered to 12.5%. In addition, local authorities will need to finance the construction of 10.6 million apartments in 2012, at a cost of over 1% of GDP.</p>

Export growth is expected to be dragged down further by lacklustre activity in Europe. Property developers face strong headwinds, suggesting that commercial housing starts are likely to fall further in 2012, though this will be partly offset by the increase in social housing construction. By mid‑2012, developments in inflation and housing prices should permit the PBoC to start lowering interest rates, boosting domestic demand and GDP in 2013. With a negative output gap persisting, inflation should continue to moderate. Even so, it is projected to remain above the average rate of the past decade and the rate prevalent in China’s principal trading partners, worsening competitiveness. As a result, the current account surplus is projected to continue to fall relative to GDP, to about 2% in 2013.</p>

Individuals have been holding back from purchasing houses and developers carry a rising level of unsold inventory. While the exit of small developers would not pose a problem, the failure of large promoters could put some bank lending at risk, perhaps triggering negative chain reactions. These would be accentuated by the prevalence of pre-funding by purchasers who would be exposed to significant losses as prices fell and would also adversely impact construction activity, so affecting migrant workers. Besides these domestic risks, external demand might weaken more than anticipated.</p>

However, the use of excessive bank lending to finance local government expenditure needs to be guarded against. But monetary stimulus would be much more effective if interest rates became more market determined. A step-by-step deregulation could start with bank interest rates at one-year and longer maturities, allowing higher returns to investors.

          <emphasis emph="bold">Growth has moderated and, against the backdrop of a weakening global economy, is projected to remain relatively subdued and reliant on private consumption in the near term. Despite the cooling in activity, inflation remains persistently above the Reserve Bank of India’s comfort level. With inflation expectations also high, price pressures are likely to recede only gradually in response to easing demand and a stabilisation of commodity prices. An improvement in external conditions and some strengthening in business investment should lead to a pick-up in growth in the second half of 2012. The government needs to adhere to its strategy to further reduce the fiscal deficit to support monetary policy in achieving a sustained reduction in inflation.</emphasis>

However, so far this year, spending has risen faster than expected and energy subsidies, in particular, are likely to overshoot, and slowing activity will curb revenues. Moreover, the government’s privatisation programme is way behind target and is now being held back by softening business confidence and falling equity prices. To support monetary policy disinflation efforts, the government needs to adhere to its strategy to reduce the deficit by constraining spending growth.</p>

The lagged effects of significant monetary policy tightening will also continue to mount, acting as a further drag. A recovery in global activity and the associated boost to Indian export demand, as well as improving domestic sentiment, are not expected to support a marked pick-up in growth until late 2012. In the coming months, delayed pass-through of higher international oil prices and recent rupee depreciation will contribute to price pressures. High inflation expectations will also make disinflation more difficult. However, slower growth will increase spare capacity which, together with an assumed levelling-off in commodity prices, is expected to gradually ease inflation pressures.</p>

The current account deficit has narrowed recently, primarily thanks to terms-of-trade gains. It is expected to remain at relatively modest levels of around 2% of GDP through 2012 and 2013, supported by further small improvements in the terms of trade. A recent strong upswing in net inflows of foreign direct investment signals foreign investor confidence which, together with high interest rates, is expected to underpin continued firm capital inflows.</p>

Imports are expected to rise more rapidly than exports, not least due to high import demand for capital goods and intermediates, thus reversing the current account surplus. The pace of employment growth is likely to easily accommodate new labour-market entrants. Inflation could exceed the target range in 2012 owing to temporary effects from energy-subsidy reductions, but should fall back inside the range in 2013.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Although confidence has weakened amid the global slowdown and financial turmoil, growth momentum seems likely to be sustained, supported by still-high oil prices. The food price shock has dissipated and the strong harvest in 2011 is now reinforcing disinflation. With credit growth moderating and the output gap remaining negative, inflation is projected to fall towards 5% in 2013. The budget is expected to be balanced or in a small surplus in 2011, aided by high oil prices, but to return to deficit in 2012-13 due to a large rise in spending next year. The already wide non-oil budget deficit is projected to increase slightly in 2012 before falling back gradually. The current account surplus should narrow due to buoyant import growth. A sharp oil price correction and renewed turbulence in financial markets remain the key risk factors.</emphasis>

Confidence weakened in August-September 2011 amid the global slowdown and a flight to safe assets which affected Russia together with other emerging markets. As capital outflows accelerated, the stock market declined sharply and, despite central bank intervention, the rouble lost 9% against the dollar‑euro reference basket between July and October. Nevertheless, with the oil price still high, the projection remains one in which growth over the next two years is close to potential of around 4%. Based on an assumed constant oil price (Brent) of USD 110 per barrel, the current account surplus should narrow due to steady import growth. Capital outflows are expected to abate, and net flows may even turn positive in 2012 as domestic political uncertainty linked to the forthcoming elections subsides, especially if global economic conditions improve.</p>

          <p id="OCDEid1055629" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">As the effect of last year’s food price shock faded away, disinflation has resumed, aided by the strong harvest in 2011. The year-on-year inflation rate has fallen steeply from 9.6% in May to 7.2% in October. Notwithstanding some passthrough of recent weakness of the rouble to domestic prices, year-on-year inflation is expected to decline further through the end of 2011. Moderation in credit growth, remaining slack in the economy and an easing of upward pressure from commodity prices point to a further slowdown in inflation in 2012. The recent decision to push back regulated tariff adjustments from January to July 2012 and to restrict the maximum increases at that time will exert a downward influence on inflation next year, although it is regrettable from the perspective of economic efficiency, given the need to raise the relative price of energy in Russia.</p>

During the third quarter of 2011, it intervened in both directions, buying foreign exchange in July-August before spending about USD 6 billion in September to support the rouble. This led to a liquidity squeeze and pushed interbank rates up somewhat. The CBR has kept its main lending and deposit rates negative in real terms in 2011, while narrowing the gap between them. The CBR lending rate is expected to move into positive territory in real terms as the cyclical upturn proceeds.</p>

Over the past year headline inflation has moved up from near the bottom of the 3‑6 per cent target band of the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) to near the top, but most of that increase came from higher food and fuel prices. Core inflation rose by only 0.7 percentage point in the year to September 2011, reaching 4.3%. Inflation expectations moved up with the rise in the headline rate, but remain consistent with the SARB’s target range. Inflation is expected to test the upper end of that range in late 2011 and early 2012 before falling back as base effects become more favourable.</p>

Given the large negative output gap and adequately anchored inflation expectations, this was well judged. Along with other emerging markets, South Africa has been hit by a wave of risk aversion in international capital markets since September, and the rand weakened sharply. There is likely to be some passthrough of that exchange rate move to consumer prices, but the SARB should continue to look through such temporary factors, and may need to ease further if demand growth continues to disappoint.</p>

The scope for fiscal stimulus in the event of an economic slowdown is therefore less than it would have been if fiscal policy had been more countercyclical. The Treasury should continue to place increasing emphasis on the structural balance, for which it could eventually adopt medium-term targets. Such a rule could usefully be buttressed by an expenditure rule to restrain procyclical spending increases in good times.</p>

Underlying inflation looks well anchored within the target range of the SARB, and the negative output gap suggests that, despite some continuing cost-push pressures, inflation will ease over the next two years. In the event of a weakening of the economy, there therefore appears to be scope for further reductions in the SARB’s policy rate.</p>

Over the longer term, higher labour force participation will be needed, and activation policies will be important.

This implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may occur, though these in general are quite small. In some countries, official forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD. The cut-off date for information used in the compilation of the projections is 22 November 2011.</p>
