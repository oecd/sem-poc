      <p id="IDa5b50bbf-1b4a-4641-8d46-ae2ebbec738c" indent="n" numbering="n">After five years
                of crisis, the global economy is weakening again. In this we are not facing a new
                pattern. Over the recent past, signs of emergence from the crisis have more than
                once given way to a renewed slowdown or even a double-dip recession in some
                countries. The risk of a new major contraction cannot be ruled out. A recession is
                ongoing in the euro area. The US economy is growing but performance remains below
                what was expected earlier this year. A slowdown has surfaced in many emerging market
                economies, partly reflecting the impact of the recession in Europe. </p>
      <p id="ID9b6f7524-fbef-4878-a190-147ba7f4d90c" indent="y" numbering="n">The weaker
                outlook has several causes. A significant drop in confidence is a key driver. This
                takes place against a background of deleveraging, simultaneous fiscal consolidation
                across countries and a large multiplier, and weakening global trade. High and, in
                some countries, rising unemployment is further depressing confidence and spending. </p>
      <p id="ID34fd061d-eeda-47b3-a594-34fc85cb72e8" indent="y" numbering="n">Lack of
                confidence largely reflects insufficient or ineffective policy responses, both in
                terms of too little short-term action and a lack of credible long-term strategies.
                This, in turn, seems to be determined not so much by a lack of understanding of the
                policy requirements, but rather by failure to reach consensus on the policy
                response. The fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling in the United States, and the
                management of the euro area crisis are two cases in point. Policy challenges, both
                macroeconomic and structural, are present in emerging market economies as well,
                reflecting a range of country-specific conditions. </p>
      <p id="ID6ea485a2-edc1-4e2e-bb19-d44a739bb84a" indent="y" numbering="n">Failure to take
                sufficient action now could have significant consequences on the global outlook. If
                the fiscal cliff is not avoided, a large negative shock could bring the US and the
                global economy into recession. In the euro area, where the greatest threats to the
                world economy remain, progress in adjustment and in strengthening institutions has
                been significant over the recent past. However, challenging fiscal sustainability
                conditions in some countries risk sparking a chain of events that could considerably
                harm activity in the monetary union and push the global economy into recession, as
                described in a downside scenario in this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic
                    Outlook</emphasis>. </p>
      <p id="IDec79b07c-1950-4b56-9fc6-d260ffadf02f" indent="y" numbering="n">The crisis in
                the euro area is being sustained by three negative feedback loops that amplify
                shocks and interact. Solvency fears for banks and their sovereigns<emphasis emph="bold"> </emphasis>are feeding on each other due to government guarantees
                for banks and bank holdings of government bonds. The possibility of exit from
                monetary union<emphasis emph="bold"> </emphasis>pushes up yields, which in turn
                reinforces breakup fears. Worries about government debt are<emphasis emph="bold"> </emphasis>also<emphasis emph="bold"> </emphasis>driving up yields, which
                further weigh on debt dynamics. Against such a fragile background, it is not
                difficult to imagine a situation in which something goes wrong, for example a
                programme country is unable to deliver or the new EU rescue mechanisms cannot be
                deployed in time with sufficient impact. This would precipitate a deterioration in
                market risk assessments, inverting the positive trend which has emerged over recent
                months. In addition, rising unemployment could trigger reform fatigue and social
                resistance. The euro area, which is witnessing significant fragmentation pressures,
                could be in danger.</p>
      <p id="ID13f19285-ad03-4004-80ed-6791ca6c099f" indent="y" numbering="n">A positive
                policy response, avoiding the downside scenario and securing more sustainable
                growth, is possible. It should be based on the full use of available policy tools:
                monetary, fiscal, and structural. </p>
      <p id="IDd5b44af9-716b-4106-9f35-1c63668f5f0c" indent="y" numbering="n">The monetary
                policy stance should be further eased in many economies. Current policies in the
                United States are appropriate as the employment outlook is improving only slowly and
                inflation expectations are well anchored. Additional easing is required in the euro
                area, Japan and some emerging market economies, including China and India. In a
                longer-term perspective, however, it should be kept in mind that unconventional
                monetary stimulus, while necessary in the current situation, involves negative
                risks. Keeping long-term rates very low for a long period could delay necessary
                deleveraging and prompt excessive risk-taking and resource misallocation. </p>
      <p id="IDb4cd461b-f7d7-4530-9117-9d4fe694c17d" indent="y" numbering="n">Excessive
                near-term fiscal consolidation should be avoided, given high fiscal multipliers at
                present. In the United States, budgetary tightening should proceed at a more
                measured pace than currently legislated, in the context of a detailed medium-term
                consolidation plan. This framework needs to be established. In the euro area,
                structural budgetary tightening should be limited to that embedded in current fiscal
                commitments, with the automatic stabilisers operating freely. To enhance
                credibility, this policy should be set out and communicated in a coordinated
                fashion. In the large majority of euro area countries, underlying budget positions
                by the end of the projection period will be consistent with declining debt-to-GDP
                ratios with a further positive impact on confidence.</p>
      <p id="ID25c8626b-c7de-4920-ace4-e581e622bdfe" indent="y" numbering="n">In Japan, given
                the extraordinarily high sovereign debt ratio, a more detailed and credible
                medium-term fiscal consolidation programme needs to be established. High
                indebtedness limits the room for manoeuvre, in the event of a negative shock, to
                allow automatic stabilisers to work. </p>
      <p id="ID48efe338-0a46-49eb-b79f-888f08605b87" indent="y" numbering="n">If serious
                downside risks were to materialise, further policy support would be essential. Lower
                interest rates, where possible, and much stronger additional quantitative easing
                would be warranted in major OECD economies. Temporary fiscal stimulus should be
                provided by countries with robust fiscal positions (including Germany and China).
                Most other economies should either slow planned budgetary consolidation or, in the
                case of those with very high debt levels or under intense market pressure, allow the
                automatic stabilisers to operate fully. </p>
      <p id="ID4ca497fa-aaa7-41e0-9e96-7ec10083d62b" indent="y" numbering="n">Structural
                policies have already been activated in many countries. These reforms should be
                fully implemented. They could begin delivering fruit sooner than expected in terms
                of higher growth, better employment performance, and sustainable current account
                rebalancing, especially in the euro area where ongoing rebalancing reflects cyclical
                weakness more than underlying structural adjustment. Ambitious reforms are needed in
                all countries to boost growth potential and make the adjustment more symmetric.</p>
      <p id="ID245eb59a-b8be-48fb-a87d-e3b3111a6f18" indent="y" numbering="n">Strong
                institutions, such as independent fiscal councils or credible fiscal rules, can
                provide additional support. Indeed, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis suggests that
                countries with strong institutions can enjoy market confidence beyond what would be
                warranted by their fiscal policy performance alone. </p>
      <p id="IDc21ab87e-3c08-4f97-bc15-456b39461219" indent="y" numbering="n">Institution
                building is very relevant in the euro area, where the progress has been remarkable
                over the past two years. The establishment of a crisis management mechanism based on
                the OMT/ESM buys time, but also shows the resolve to address major weaknesses in the
                structure of monetary union. Markets have reacted positively to its establishment.
                Its effectiveness, however, will ultimately depend on the progress in reform
                implementation in countries that require assistance, as well as the willingness of
                creditor countries to agree on the use of common resources. </p>
      <p id="ID939d9303-d19d-48ce-908b-8138009e7d73" indent="y" numbering="n">Progress towards
                a fully fledged banking union is essential to complete the architecture of the euro
                area and to facilitate disentangling sovereign and banking sector fragilities. This
                will involve supervision at euro area level, effective cross-border crisis
                resolution procedures, a common deposit guarantee mechanism, and a euro area fiscal
                backstop. Delays in putting the banking union in place could have negative
                consequences on the sustainability of the euro area. Furthermore, it remains
                essential to address in the coming years the capital shortage of euro area
                banks.</p>
      <p id="ID194d331d-cdb3-4196-ba3b-65056fd2e87b" indent="y" numbering="n">At the global
                level, stronger confidence and more sustained growth will require taking
                international spillovers more into account. This concern is at the heart of the G20
                agenda, a key policy institution on issues such as global imbalances and the impact
                of monetary policies on capital flows and exchange rates. Indeed, the global nature
                of the current slowdown reminds us, once again, of the need to take interdependence
                and channels of transmission into serious consideration and shape the policy
                response accordingly. </p>
      <p id="ID6cc97b78-7d10-4257-9e09-f3f685bc7cbf" indent="y" numbering="n">Decisive policy
                action to deal with the immediate challenges is a necessary condition to lengthen
                the horizon for policy. Looking beyond the forecast interval presented in this
                    <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>, the policy challenge is to
                guide the global economy forward towards a new long-term path. This requires a
                departure from the pre-crisis <shortcitation>business as usual</shortcitation>. In
                addition to repairing the financial system, policy will need to find ways to ensure
                environmental sustainability and to tackle rising inequality. New sources of growth,
                such as green growth and innovation in intangible assets, will have to play an
                increasingly important role.</p>
      <p id="IDf4814a68-5e9b-4e70-89e9-9420d6c2f51a" indent="y" numbering="n">Potential
                trade-offs between growth and equity, growth and sustainability, growth and
                environmental sustainability will have to be addressed. For example, as this
                    <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> shows, the impact on
                inequality of fiscal consolidation can be significantly different according to the
                specific consolidation strategies that are put in place. Well-designed structural
                reform packages, together with credible fiscal consolidation, are key both in
                dealing with such trade-offs and in addressing imbalances that may be associated
                with long-term growth. Even as policy deals with the immediate challenges, there is
                no need to wait any longer for such long-term strategies that can and should be
                activated now. </p>

                            Growth in the OECD area is set to be modest in the near term, with the
                            euro area remaining in or close to recession until well into 2013.
                            Headwinds stem from fiscal consolidation, household deleveraging in many
                            countries and confidence at low levels. Although conditions differ by
                            country, a quicker recovery is expected in the non-OECD area, in part
                            reflecting the greater scope for policy stimulus.</p>

                            euro area crisis remains the greatest threat to the world economy at
                            present, despite recent policy measures that have damped near-term
                            pressures. Adjustment of deep-rooted intra-area imbalances has begun,
                            but much more is needed to ensure long-term sustainability – helped by
                            structural reform in both deficit and surplus countries. As well, more
                            needs to be done to tackle adverse feedback loops between public
                            finances, bank solvency and exit risks. In the long run this requires a
                            fully-fledged banking union with common fiscal backstops. In the near
                            term, direct ESM recapitalisation of banks should be undertaken where
                            necessary, with vulnerable countries entering an EFSF/ESM programme that
                            would allow sovereign bond purchases by the ECB if needed. </p>

                        global recovery has slowed markedly over the past year, with the fragilities
                        apparent at the end of 2011 further accentuated by the recession in the euro
                        area and the unexpectedly strong slowdown in many emerging market economies.
                        The factors behind these developments include the negative spillovers from
                        the euro crisis on global activity and confidence, prolonged deleveraging in
                        the aftermath of the financial crisis, stronger effects from past policy
                        tightening than anticipated and widespread uncertainty, not least about the
                        future stance of fiscal policy but also about the extent of the slowdown in
                        trend growth in some non-OECD economies. In OECD countries outside the euro
                        area, following a pattern that has been common in past years, growth has
                        fluctuated around a modest trend. In some of these economies there remains a
                        risk that endogenous dynamic forces from high unemployment, excess
                        inventories and weak confidence could further undermine activity. Overall,
                        notwithstanding some recent signs of stabilisation, global prospects remain
                        fragile, with strong downside risks, and are heavily dependent on the speed
                        and decisiveness of policy actions. </p>

                        baseline projection presented here rests on the assumption that policy
                        actions will suffice to avert large adverse risks. Even so, only a hesitant
                        and uneven recovery is projected to occur, with growth struggling to
                        accelerate through 2013 and an unwelcome further deterioration in
                        already-weak labour market conditions (<xref refid="BDFEDGFJ" object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref"/>). OECD growth is
                        projected to be only modest in the near term, with growth holding up better
                        in the United States than in Japan, where output has declined in the latter
                        half of 2012 and where the likely resumption of growth will be modest as the
                        boost from reconstruction efforts fades gradually. The euro area is
                        projected to remain in or near recession until well into 2013 and fiscal
                        headwinds and private sector deleveraging are expected to be sizable.
                        Against this background, OECD unemployment could continue to rise until
                        mid-2013 and drift down only slowly thereafter. Widening economic slack is
                        putting downward pressure on inflation in the euro area but, as elsewhere,
                        well-anchored inflation expectations help to moderate changes in inflation.
                        Though differentiated in terms of pace and extent, the recovery in the key
                        non-OECD economies is projected to be a little quicker than in the OECD
                        area, in part reflecting the greater scope for policy stimulus to support
                        activity in many of these countries. If key adverse risks cannot be averted,
                        and especially if the euro area crisis were to intensify significantly, the
                        likely outcome would be considerably weaker, potentially plunging the global
                        economy into deep recession and deflation, with large additional rises in
                        unemployment.</p>

                                tightening in many countries into early 2012 and the deepening of

                                economies is relatively high, reflecting both the high share of
                                exports to the euro area in total exports, and a high share of total
                                exports in GDP. Outside Europe, exposure  is  comparatively  higher

                                2¾ per cent in the first half of 2012 (a.r.). The volumes of goods

                                respectively. In contrast, the volume of imports from all of these

                                of euro area banks, available only with a considerable lag, point to
                                mixed developments since mid-2011. There was a sharp contraction in
                                euro area banks’ cross-border credit to emerging market economies in
                                the latter half of 2011, when strains in euro area financial markets

                                 quarter  of  2012.  Cross-border claims on China and Brazil rose,
                                offset by further declines in claims on emerging European economies,
                                including Russia. Euro area banks have cut back relatively sharply
                                on loans with high risk weights, such as leveraged loans or project
                                finance, and for loans that often require dollar funding, such as
                                aircraft and ship leases and trade financing (BIS, 2012). With euro
                                area banks providing a high proportion of global trade finance,
                                constraints on their lending could be having an adverse impact on
                                trade growth this year, although there are signs that non-European
                                banks are replacing a considerable part of the shortfall in lending
                                by European banks in some regions, especially Asia (Vause <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2012a).</p>

                                (discussed in the policy section below) could be subtracting some 1
                                to 1½ percentage points from OECD-wide growth in 2012 and more for
                                the euro area. The size of the drag reflects the spillovers that
                                arise from simultaneous consolidation in many countries, especially
                                in the euro area, increasing standard fiscal multipliers by around a
                                third according to model simulations, and the limited scope for
                                monetary policy to react, possibly increasing the multipliers by an
                                additional one-third. It also mirrors the fact that reductions in
                                public expenditure typically account for the bulk of consolidation
                                in most countries. This is likely beneficial for long-term growth
                                prospects, but it implies a bigger drag on near-term growth. In
                                current circumstances, the negative short-term impact of
                                consolidation could be even larger than mentioned above. This is
                                particularly the case in some euro area countries, where
                                pre-existing weakness and dysfunctional financial systems might
                                limit the ability of households and firms to smooth spending in the

                                in the OECD area. Recent indicators of new capital goods orders and
                                shipments in the major economies have been particularly weak and
                                point to subdued near-term outcomes. This partly reflects the
                                underlying weakness of final demand, fading confidence, and, in the
                                euro area, tightening financial constraints (<xref refid="IDdf624b3e-3e1d-4ec6-bfa0-c875ab35bc64" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).
                                Anecdotal evidence also suggests that economic policy uncertainty,
                                for example uncertainty over the US <shortcitation>fiscal
                                    cliff</shortcitation> and debt ceiling, may also be delaying
                                investment projects at present, although in contrast to the latter
                                half of 2011, market-based measures of uncertainty, such as stock
                                market volatility, remain at very low levels. Investment growth is
                                likely to remain subdued until a clear cyclical upturn in demand
                                gets underway and financial conditions improve. In the euro area,
                                investment could be softer than elsewhere, damped by weak bank
                                lending. Outside the OECD area, infrastructure spending is boosting
                                public investment in China, but slowing trend growth has raised
                                uncertainty about the strength of business investment.</p>

                                subdued growth of real disposable incomes amidst worsening labour
                                market conditions and the need for balance sheet adjustments. Demand
                                for durable goods has eased considerably, especially in the euro
                                area where car sales plummeted by 23% at an annualised rate in the
                                third quarter, though it has held up relatively well in China,
                                Indonesia and some other emerging market economies. Consumer
                                confidence has deteriorated further in the euro area this year, and
                                remains low relative to historic norms in many other OECD economies
                                    (<xref refid="IDd0786e0d-ab13-4f27-aafd-8ae2c61f713e" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). However, despite recent setbacks, stronger
                                equity prices are supporting household balance sheets. Moreover, in
                                a handful of countries, including the United States, rising house
                                prices and progress in debt deleveraging are further improving net
                                worth. In such countries, additional balance sheet adjustment will
                                be able to take place with saving ratios at or just below current
                                levels and consumption continuing to rise modestly. In 2013-14, the
                                US saving ratio is projected to be 1 percentage point lower than in
                                2012. For the euro area in aggregate, where debt deleveraging has
                                yet to get underway and area-wide house prices are declining, saving
                                ratios seem more likely to rise and consumption is likely to remain
                                weak in the near term, especially in countries with soaring
                                unemployment. Germany may be an exception, with strong household
                                balance sheets and a tight labour market helping to support demand.
                                In Japan, future consumption patterns seem likely to reflect
                                pre-announced indirect tax rises, with expenditure rising
                                immediately prior to the increase and falling immediately after.</p>

                                strong growth in real house prices in Germany is more than offset by
                                large price declines in the countries under market pressure, and
                                declines in the Netherlands and, more recently, Belgium and France,
                                where price-rent ratios remain high (<xref refid="ID2ddf58e7-1b63-4f51-8624-8205f9aff374" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). In
                                contrast, US housing market conditions are now improving slowly,
                                with the price-rent ratio having declined back to its long-run
                                average and builders’ optimism, transaction prices, sales and
                                housing starts all turning up. Real housing investment is now making
                                a positive contribution to GDP growth. Further improvements are
                                projected, with nominal mortgage rates at very low levels, though
                                mortgage lending standards remain tight and a shadow inventory still

                                in the year. Nonetheless, the proportion of banks reporting tighter
                                credit standards did not ease further in the third quarter and
                                serious problems remain, or, in some cases, still build in the

                                virtually all types of borrowers. The overall funding costs of large

                        euro area crisis, the US fiscal cliff and debt ceiling, the extent to which
                        growth can rebound in the emerging market economies given uncertainties
                        about potential output growth, and the possibility that self-reinforcing
                        endogenous dynamics might slow demand even further. Particularly challenging
                        fiscal sustainability conditions in some euro area countries also create an
                        event risk. The projection presented here rests on the assumption that the
                        key risks identified above can be reduced successfully and that other
                        downside risks do not materialise, although, in the euro area especially,

                                gradually through the projection period. Private consumption growth
                                should be supported by improving labour market conditions and a

                                Aggregate financial conditions have improved a little and monetary
                                policy is increasingly accommodative, but the impact of this on
                                area-wide activity will appear only slowly, reflecting the impaired

                                but to only modest rates. Domestic demand will be held back by the

                                brought forward to before the tax increase, although offsetting
                                changes in the household saving rate and stockbuilding could help
                                smooth the overall activity profile. A recovery in export growth, as
                                external demand strengthens, and a corresponding improvement in
                                business investment are likely to be the main forces supporting the
                                recovery, with the unemployment rate falling marginally through the
                                projection period.</p>

                                now beginning to pick up slowly in the major emerging market
                                economies, with increasingly supportive monetary and fiscal policies
                                offsetting the drag exerted by weak external demand. In China,
                                output growth has begun to edge up on a quarterly basis, helped by
                                the acceleration of public infrastructure spending. Growth is
                                expected to stabilise at just below 9% by 2014, with macroeconomic
                                policy easing, an improving housing market and increased outlays on
                                social spending supporting domestic demand. In India, annual GDP
                                growth is expected to strengthen gradually, to around 6% in 2013 and
                                7% in 2014, with improving financial conditions and a normalisation
                                of agricultural output boosting activity, and diminishing
                                inflationary pressures providing greater scope for monetary easing
                                and reducing the drag on household real incomes. In Brazil, the
                                period of weak growth appears to have ended, helped by strong and
                                timely monetary and fiscal stimulus, and GDP growth is projected to
                                be close to potential rates, at around 4% per annum in both 2013 and
                                2014. Domestic demand is expected to remain robust, amidst strong
                                investment growth and a tight labour market, offset in part by small
                                net export declines. In Russia, GDP growth is expected to strengthen
                                to around 4% per annum in 2013-14, helped by the near-term effects
                                of fiscal easing, the high level of oil prices and the gradual
                                fading of headwinds from the euro area crisis.</p>

                        most major economies either stable at low levels or drifting down. Higher
                        food prices will continue to push up headline inflation a little until early
                        2013, especially in emerging market economies. Long-term inflation
                        expectations in the OECD economies remain reasonably well anchored, although
                        market-based measures have drifted up a little in the United States since
                        the introduction of the QE3 programme. The anchoring of inflation
                        expectations should help check disinflationary pressures, though substantial
                        spare capacity in many OECD economies will keep price inflation below
                        official inflation objectives in the coming years (<xref refid="ID07bb3757-fe78-4c37-8632-4ddfc07335a2" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>), notwithstanding
                        uncertainty about the precise degree of slack at the current juncture. Core
                        inflation is set to remain subdued in the United States, edging up
                        eventually to around 2% during 2014, broadly in line with the projected
                        growth of unit labour costs. In the euro area, widening slack could push
                        core inflation down to around 1¼ per cent by 2014.<fnote id="ID-42-1247134"><p id="ID029473d8-eacd-4a55-ae4b-cdf9b8a24bde" indent="y" numbering="n">Past rises in administered prices and indirect taxes are currently
                                adding around ½ percentage point to the annual rate of headline
                                inflation in the euro area, allowing for possible double counting
                                from indirect taxes levied on administered prices. In September, the
                                latest month for which comparable data are available, the euro area
                                annual rate of headline inflation was 2.6%; the annual rates
                                excluding administered prices and indirect tax increases were 2.4%
                                and 2% respectively. The annual rate of core inflation is likely
                                boosted by the same factors and was running at 1.5% in
                                September.</p></fnote> In Japan, deflation is expected to diminish gradually over the
                        projection period, with the impact of the first of the planned increases in
                        the consumption tax rate adding around 2% to the price level during 2014. In
                        the major emerging market economies, a period of below-trend growth has
                        likely resulted in negative output gaps, helping to place downward pressure
                        on inflation. That said, the size of the output gaps is unclear, given
                        uncertainties about potential growth rates, but the likely cyclical upturn
                        is not projected to be at a pace that would raise core inflation
                        significantly. </p>

                        OECD this arises in part from uncertainty about the impact of both the
                        crisis and the subsequent prolonged period of sub-par growth on potential,

                        actually is. In such circumstances, judgements about prospective
                        inflationary pressures need to pay greater attention to survey-based
                        measures of slack and to the gap between actual and potential growth
                        (Orphanides, 2003; Pain and Röhn, 2011).<fnote id="ID-42-1247159"><p id="ID925a57ff-1589-44e3-b4b4-427004ecdfc1" indent="y" numbering="n">Long-lasting one-sided errors are less likely to occur in such

                        unemployment in Germany has stalled as growth has eased, though unemployment
                        has continued to drift down in the United States despite only modest job
                        growth, with the labour force participation rate having fallen to its lowest
                        level since 1980. Estimates derived using simple equations relating the

                        Unemployment is set to remain high or even rise further in many countries.
                        Indeed, weak survey measures of hiring intentions, the likelihood of a
                        further period of sub-par output growth and uncertainty possibly postponing
                        hiring decisions (Leduc and Liu, 2012) are all suggestive of weak employment

                        OECD-wide level around 16 million more people are out of work than at the
                        end of 2007, just before the crisis began. Furthermore, high long-term
                        unemployment in some countries raises concerns that the persistent cyclical
                        increase in unemployment could increasingly become structural. A related
                        concern is that the increase in the number of discouraged workers could also
                        become permanent. In some countries, including the United States, the United
                        Kingdom and Sweden, the Beveridge curve (an indicator of efficiency of job
                        matching in the labour market relating the unemployment rate to the vacancy
                        rate) has recently shifted to the right (implying a higher unemployment rate
                        for a given vacancy rate), possibly suggesting that matching frictions have
                        risen (OECD, 2012c; Hobijn and Sahin, 2012).<fnote id="ID-42-1247186"><p id="IDecd94287-34de-402f-91af-15df3ad0f623" indent="y" numbering="n">Possible reasons include: a reduction in job search intensity due,
                                for example, to extensions in benefit duration or less-intensive
                                searching by the long-term unemployed; or a reduction in
                                    <shortcitation>recruitment intensity</shortcitation> (Davis
                                    <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2012), with firms
                                more willing to wait for suitable workers during a period of soft
                                demand.</p></fnote> However, it could also simply reflect a normal cyclical pattern
                        (Daly <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>., 2012), with vacancy rates
                        responding to cyclical conditions more rapidly than the unemployment rate.
                        As discussed in detail in OECD (2012a, b), labour market reforms remain
                        essential to foster near-term employment growth, facilitate wage adjustment,
                        particularly in the euro area, and reduce the risk that higher unemployment
                        becomes entrenched. Product market reforms to relax regulatory restrictions
                        in sectors in which there is a strong potential for new job growth, such as
                        retail trade and professional services, could also improve labour market
                        outcomes relatively quickly.<fnote id="ID-42-1247215"><p id="ID83728d73-4e84-4d64-9c58-fe653c561fb7" indent="y" numbering="n">Structural measures that might help to improve long-term labour
                                market outcomes, such as rebalancing employment protection towards
                                less strict protection for regular workers, but more protection for
                                temporary workers, and reductions in unemployment benefit duration,
                                may be less effective when labour demand is particularly weak.</p></fnote> An encouraging development is that the recent intensity of labour
                        market structural reforms is particularly strong in those countries in which
                        sizable fiscal consolidation is being undertaken, where such reforms are
                        often needed the most and offer the largest potential gains – albeit
                        possibly also the largest near-term costs because the reforms are introduced
                        in conditions of particularly depressed activity (Bouis and Duval,
                        2011).</p>

                                overview of the stall speed concept, and recent attempts to estimate

              <p id="ID4fa23e1b-4b2c-426c-85de-066a6a52d486" indent="y" numbering="n">The stall-speed concept, as it has been used in the recent
                                literature, refers to a rate of output growth below which a cyclical
                                upswing turns into a period of weak growth and then possibly into
                                recession (Sheets and Sockin, 2011 and 2012). An analogy can be
                                drawn with the gap between actual and potential output growth, with
                                stall-speed growth corresponding to a period of below-trend positive
                                output growth. A variant of the stall-speed concept is that, at a
                                certain prolonged period of low output growth, it is more likely
                                that low growth will be followed by a recession rather than an
                                acceleration in output growth. Self-fulfilling forces such as rising
                                unemployment and declining confidence generate further weakness in
                                activity via higher household saving rates and cutbacks in private
                                investment, and the economy becomes more vulnerable to negative
                                shocks.</p>

                                        real GDP growth rate falling below 2%. The probability of a

                                        and Sockin (2012) provide estimates of ranges of output
                                        growth (stall-speed thresholds) below which there is a
                                        statistically significant chance of a decline in output
                                        growth of equal or greater magnitude than the current growth
                                        rate within the subsequent year. For the United States, the
                                        stall-speed thresholds are estimated to occur for growth
                                        rates between 1½‑2 per cent. The corresponding stall-speed
                                        thresholds estimated for the euro area, Japan and the United

                                        Australia, the concept appears less useful, with significant
                                        stall speeds being found only when the growth has slipped
                                        close to zero.</p>

                                        for the United States a period of low positive GDP growth is
                                        as likely to be followed by faster growth as it is by even
                                        slower growth, including recession. However, if the period
                                        of low positive GDP growth follows a period of faster
                                        growth, there is a significant chance that it, in turn, will
                                        be followed by a recession, as found by Sheets and Sockin
                                        (2012). In a low-growth period following a recession, the
                                        chance of moving into a higher-growth period is found to be
                                        over twice as large as the chance of slipping back into

                                periods in which low growth has followed high growth, it is not
                                clear how relevant it is for the current low-growth situation, since
                                there has not been a sustained period of strong growth beforehand.
                                Nonetheless, the risk of a renewed slowdown via self-fullfilling
                                endogenous dynamic forces remains when output growth is weak for a
                                sustained period.</p>

                                over which growth stalls may both vary over time, reflecting changes
                                in the structure of the economy. For instance, the stall-speed
                                thresholds for Japan and the euro area estimated on historical data
                                by Sheets and Sockin (2012) are close to OECD estimates of current
                                potential output growth in both economies. This suggests that
                                stall-speed estimates should be endogenous and change as potential
                                output growth estimates vary over time. There are also likely to be
                                issues in selecting the relevant period of GDP growth to calculate
                                stall speeds if an early warning of recession is to be provided. For
                                instance, in the 2008-09 recession and using year-on-year GDP growth
                                rates, annual GDP growth in the United States, Japan, the euro area
                                and the United Kingdom fell within the stall-speed thresholds

                                growth pick-up in emerging market economies than projected. In many
                                emerging market economies, with Brazil a notable exception, there
                                has yet to be aggressive policy easing as growth rates have slowed
                                below recent trend rates. One possible factor behind this is
                                uncertainty about the true extent of economic slack and downward
                                reassessments of recent and future potential output. In China, the
                                labour market remains tight, despite the easing of growth, limiting
                                the extent to which future growth can be met by increased hiring.
                                Moreover, as with many other emerging markets, there is also a
                                possibility that potential growth rates may be over-estimated as a
                                result of an excessive investment rate in the past fuelled by strong
                                credit growth, resulting in investments with very low economic
                                returns being undertaken. A further downside risk in China, with
                                negative spillovers to other countries (Ahuja and Nabar, 2012),
                                arises from the difficulties of sustaining a stable, high GDP growth
                                rate in the context of the ongoing process to lower the share of
                                fixed investment in aggregate demand and raise the share of
                                household consumption significantly.</p>

                                outside the euro area, structural fiscal balances and the oil price.
                                Calculations using this framework suggest that much of the widening
                                of current account imbalances between the introduction of the single
                                currency and the start of the crisis is associated with divergences
                                in relative cost competitiveness within the euro area. In a
                                simulation that maintains relative unit labour costs at their 1998
                                levels, aggregate current account imbalances (measured as the sum of
                                absolute current balances of individual euro area countries divided
                                by two) increase from 1% of euro area GDP in 1998 to a maximum of
                                1.8% in 2007 just prior to the crisis, as compared with an actual
                                maximum of 2.6%. These calculations are illustrative only, as the
                                direction of causation between competitiveness and the current
                                account runs both ways.</p>
              <p id="ID19140205-1539-489a-8f0a-eb07958ac6ea" indent="y" numbering="n">Since 2007, total-economy relative unit labour costs of euro area
                                countries under financial market stress have come down, bringing
                                current account deficits down with them. Greece and Ireland are
                                already back to their 1998 competitiveness levels relative to the
                                rest of the euro area – that is, back to the level prevailing at the
                                beginning of monetary union. Portugal and Spain need only an extra
                                5-7% reduction in relative unit labour costs to reach this
                                benchmark. Italy has not reduced relative unit labour costs since
                                the crisis, and they remain 15% higher than in 1998, though a small
                                decline in absolute unit labour costs is projected to occur in 2014.
                                Much of the falls in total-economy unit labour costs may be due to
                                cuts in public-sector employment and wages, however, with smaller
                                adjustments in tradable sectors and thus in external
                                competitiveness. Also, a significant part of the improvement in
                                external balances in these euro area countries since 2007 is related
                                to a collapse in economic activity. Correcting for its much weaker
                                cyclical position as compared with its trading partners, Spain’s
                                cyclically-adjusted current account deficit in 2012 is estimated to
                                be 3.3% of GDP (as opposed to a projected 2%), with similar
                                adjustments for Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal (see chart).
                                Thus, a generalised recovery in the euro area with no further
                                changes in competitiveness and relative domestic demand would imply
                                some re-emergence of current account imbalances.</p>

                                competitiveness of countries under market pressure approaching 1998
                                levels, not only do cyclically-adjusted imbalances remain, but
                                external debt has increased substantially in these countries. Hence,
                                simply attaining relative competitiveness positions within the euro
                                area at 1998 levels would probably be insufficient to restore
                                sustainable external positions. Only Ireland has a current account
                                balance that, once adjusted for its relative cyclical position, is
                                consistent with reducing net external debt to 35% of GDP in the next
                                two decades, assuming nominal GDP growth of 3%. Being based on a
                                simple framework, this assessment leaves out other important
                                considerations in the sustainability of external positions, such as
                                the evolution of relative competitiveness outside the euro area, the
                                interest rate paid on foreign liabilities, or the influence of
                                non-price competitiveness. It also abstracts from the contribution
                                that fiscal consolidation will make to external adjustment, which is
                                set to be large in the countries concerned. Even so, adjustment
                                costs are likely to be substantial before external balances are
                                sustainable, even if much adjustment has already occurred.</p>

                                little to help imbalances within the euro area as they would
                                probably boost the pre-existing imbalances in surplus countries by
                                more than they would reduce the imbalances in deficit
                                countries. Even so, euro depreciation would contribute towards the
                                external sustainability of Greece, Portugal and Spain, although
                                estimates from this framework suggest that the boost to the current

                                reductions in unit labour costs in countries under financial stress,
                                but they could just as well occur through increases in unit labour
                                costs in the rest of the euro area, or a combination of the two.
                                Higher inflation in surplus countries, together with a rebalancing
                                of spending toward domestic demand, would indeed help reduce euro
                                area imbalances with or without further declines in unit labour
                                costs in deficit countries. A 23% increase in unit labour costs
                                relative to the rest of the euro area would be needed in Germany to
                                restore 1998 relative competitiveness levels, for instance. If
                                rebalancing takes place only in the countries under financial market
                                stress, the costs would be very high as downward adjustments to
                                relative wages and prices in these countries are currently occurring
                                through economic weakness and high unemployment.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1274515" indent="y" numbering="n">Euro area countries
                                experiencing financial market pressure can reduce such adjustment
                                costs by making their labour market more flexible. Studies indeed
                                show that the output/employment costs of reducing inflation tend to
                                be lower in countries that have more flexible labour markets, for
                                instance less restrictive employment protection laws. Greece,
                                Portugal and Spain have relatively inflexible labour markets (Venn,
                                2009), so efforts already under way in these countries to make
                                labour markets more flexible are steps in the right direction,
                                although greater labour market dynamism could lead to larger
                                employment losses in the short term. </p>
              <p id="ID-42-1274520" indent="y" numbering="n">More broadly, other
                                structural reforms can also help improve competitiveness by boosting
                                productivity. Employment protection legislation reforms, in addition
                                to lowering the employment costs of restoring competitiveness, could
                                raise productivity by between ½ and 1¾ per cent over 10 years in
                                Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland (Bouis and Duval, 2011).
                                The scope for product market reform in many of the euro area
                                countries where competitiveness needs to improve further is also
                                considerable. OECD estimates suggest that for Italy, Spain, Greece
                                and Portugal, fast implementation of product market reforms could
                                raise productivity by 3-4% over five years and 7-8% over 10 years.
                                For productivity improvements to be reflected in lower unit labour
                                costs, wages would have to rise by less than productivity, but this
                                is more likely to occur in economies where demand conditions are
                                very depressed and unemployment high, as is the case now where
                                financial market pressures are greatest.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1274525" indent="y" numbering="n">Finally, and as mentioned
                                above, the countries with the largest current account deficits also
                                tend to be those with the largest fiscal deficits. Ongoing fiscal
                                consolidation in these countries has already reduced current account
                                deficits substantially. While fiscal consolidation efforts must be
                                balanced against growth concerns in the short term, ambitious
                                medium-term fiscal targets would help to ensure a continued
                                reduction in current account imbalances once recoveries are under
                                way. Relative to a scenario in which all countries undertake up to ½
                                percentage point of GDP of fiscal consolidation per year to
                                stabilise debt-to-GDP ratios, an alternative scenario in which gross
                                debt-to-GDP ratios are gradually reduced to 60% – with up to 1
                                percentage point of GDP of consolidation per year – could improve
                                current account balances by 1½ percentage points of GDP in Spain, 2
                                percentage points in Italy, 4 percentage points in Ireland,
                                4½ percentage points in Portugal and 7½ percentage points in Greece.
                                Such current account improvements would come only gradually, but
                                would make a substantial contribution to external sustainability and
                                reduce the need for further adjustments to cost competitiveness.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1274530" indent="y" numbering="n">While the simple
                                framework used here does not allow for the likely interaction
                                between policy channels, it does suggest that a combination of
                                reforms in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy to make both
                                product and labour markets more flexible, inflation well in excess
                                of 2% in the rest of the euro area over several years, and ambitious
                                fiscal adjustment could substantially facilitate the rebalancing
                                process and so reduce the extent to which the burden of adjustment
                                is reliant on further prolonged demand weakness.</p>

                                durable adjustment requires both a reduction in domestic spending
                                and a depreciation of the real exchange rate. Against the backdrop
                                of low inflation in the euro area as a whole, the required relative
                                price changes and expenditure switching will likely take time, but
                                can be expedited by structural reforms that enhance product and
                                labour market flexibility, and facilitate the necessary reallocation
                                of resources and adjustment of prices and wages required to regain

                                spending needs to increase and resources to be switched from
                                tradable to non-tradable sectors via an appreciation of the real
                                exchange rate and higher relative returns on capital in the service
                                sectors, driven by structural reforms. Adjustment will likely imply
                                higher domestic wages, private consumption and residential
                                investment. It will also imply higher inflation than in the run-up

                        imbalances have continued to narrow in the first half of 2012, with sharp
                        declines in domestic demand in the EU/IMF programme countries and Spain

                        monetary union. Firstly, solvency fears for banks and their sovereigns have
                        fed on each other due to implicit or explicit government guarantees for
                        banks and bank holdings of government bonds. Secondly, concerns about the
                        possibility of exit from the euro area have pushed up sovereign yields,
                        which in turn have reinforced breakup fears and increased yields further.
                        Thirdly, worries about government debt levels have driven yields up and
                        growth down, which has weighed further on debt dynamics. To terminate the

                        negative feedback loop between banks and government finances reflects a
                        number of serious weaknesses in the euro area financial system and its
                        robustness. In particular, European banks are often heavily reliant on
                        non-deposit sources of funding and not sufficiently well capitalised to deal
                        with large negative shocks, although the situation has improved a little
                        this year as a result of the successful EU-wide exercise to raise capital
                        buffers in the banking sector. Banks thus depend on explicit and implicit
                        guarantees from national authorities. This forces individual governments to
                        inject capital into their banks to save the banking system when large
                        negative shocks occur, but the accompanying weakening of public finances

                        feedback loop between sovereign and bank balance sheets would in principle
                        cease to operate if banks were seen to be so well capitalised that they
                        could withstand further sovereign weakness. Even though EU banks have
                        brought their ratio of Core Tier-1 capital to 9% of risk-weighted assets as
                        requested by the European Council in October 2011, confidence in the euro
                        area banking system remains weak. Indeed, the ratio of Core Tier-1 capital
                        to un-weighted total assets in euro-area banks falls well short of 5%,
                        identified as a benchmark for well-capitalised banks (see <emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> Blundell-Wignall and Atkinson, 2012). If
                        the largest banks in the euro area were all to respect such a minimum
                        standard, which is more demanding than the minimum Basel III leverage ratio
                        scheduled to become mandatory in 2018, they would need to raise additional
                        capital at some stage. At the present time, the capital shortage with
                        respect to a 5% standard is estimated at around EUR 400bn (4¼ per cent of
                        euro area GDP), with large capital increases necessary in banks in both core
                        and vulnerable countries (see <xref refid="IDbbf4daf9-1c5e-459d-83ff-2eab83677e96" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). Raising capital
                        through retained earnings may be made harder by bad loan losses, which may
                        increase substantially from current surprisingly low levels in some
                        countries. Hence, it is likely that national governments would have to
                        provide some of the extra capital if such a capital standard is to be
                        achieved and especially if it is to be achieved quickly. However, in the
                        current environment, such capital injections by national governments may not
                        be feasible in countries where public deficits and debt are high, limiting
                        the scope to use such measures to block the bank-sovereign loop in the
                        near‑term. Nonetheless, it remains essential to address the capital shortage
                        of euro area banks in the coming years.</p>

                                risk. A 5% leverage ratio has been recommended by the OECD and is
                                close to the median leverage ratio of the largest US and European
                                banks (Blundell-Wignall and Atkinson, 2012; Blundell-Wignall and
                                Roulet, 2012). To derive the estimates, a bottom-up approach is
                                employed by first assessing the capital addition required for each
                                individual bank to reach a leverage ratio of 5% and then adding up
                                the needs for the banks that are currently under-capitalised based
                                on this yardstick to obtain national and area-wide estimates of
                                additional capital needs. The estimates are based on consolidated
                                bank balance sheets which are prepared on an IFRS basis and refer to
                                the latest available information. It should be underlined that a 5%
                                leverage ratio does not currently form part of the internationally
                                agreed Basel III framework, which expresses capital requirements in
                                terms of risk-weighted assets, with a 3% leverage ratio to be
                                introduced as a backstop from 2018.<boxnoteref refid="IDa666983b-acbc-48fb-b751-e6bc05dd5094" format="boxnoteref"/></p>

                        Monetary Transactions (OMT) scheme. For eligible countries, the scheme
                        involves purchases of short-term (up to 3 years maturity) sovereign bonds
                        without limits in order to remove the exit risk premia in bond yields and
                        without seniority claims. Eligibility is limited to countries that have
                        established either a macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary
                        programme with the EFSF or ESM; in either case the programme could involve

                        in the secondary market would be dependent on countries fully respecting
                        programme conditionality. It remains to be clarified how the mechanism would
                        operate if there was a failure to comply with conditionality, as
                        interruption of support would spark financial instability in the sovereign

                        announcement of the OMT scheme in early August, especially at shorter
                        maturities. Even though the benefits of programme entry should have
                        increased with the OMT, the Italian and Spanish authorities have not
                        indicated that they will seek a programme, although this would be likely in
                        the case of Spain if yields were to move up again significantly. Apart from
                        possible stigma effects and political costs, reluctance to enter programmes
                        might also reflect concerns about hardening attitudes of would-be creditors
                        and the potentially more onerous conditionality required for programme
                        entry. The unanimity required for an EFSF/ESM programme gives those
                        advocating strict conditionality a strong hand. In contrast, programme
                        applicants have little bargaining power since they have to publicly
                        instigate discussions. However, even in the absence of actual programme
                        entry, the OMT scheme has reduced exit risks by creating the option of
                        programme entry. It has accordingly put limits on how far the feedback
                        between exit risk and bond yields can go, but as long as vulnerable
                        countries do not enter a programme their bond yields will remain higher than
                        otherwise. The benefits of programme entry, including sizeable cuts in
                        borrowing costs for the public and private sectors alike, and the costs of
                        abandoning a programme should increase its credibility. At the same time,
                        the decision-making process for a programme should be made as quick and
                        smooth as possible to avoid adding uncertainty and possibly sparking
                        negative market reactions.</p>

                        a useful disciplining mechanism, but this feedback can also become
                        destabilising because higher bond yields will make debt dynamics more
                        unsustainable. In the context of the euro area, this may create area-wide
                        spillovers. Destabilisation is particularly likely because market discipline
                        had been largely absent for many years, leading some countries to run up
                        high debts, before it asserted itself with a vengeance. Indeed, more

                        illustrative estimates of the possible impact effects of one particular euro
                        area scenario are set out in <xref refid="IDc265a702-ee0b-4cfb-a90f-c9d48a9ac976" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>. Although highly
                        stylised and only illustrative, with many simplifying assumptions, this
                        scenario highlights the potential scale of the counteracting policy action
                        required if it were to occur (such actions are not included in the
                        scenario), and the urgency of implementing fully the policy actions
                        necessary to minimise the chances of it occurring. Key features of the
                        stylised scenario include: large falls in the level of output in the OECD
                        economies relative to the baseline projection (<xref refid="ID8fca3a79-d711-4e42-8452-74398e123fa8" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>), especially in
                        the euro area where GDP levels could decline by over 6%, with declines of
                        around 5% in GDP levels in the United States and Japan if worldwide
                        financial stress resulted; further large increases in unemployment; the
                        level of world trade plummeting by up to 11% relative to the baseline
                        projection by the latter part of 2014; and likely deflation in many OECD
                        economies by 2014. In a worst-case situation, this downside scenario could
                        be strongly amplified by the turmoil that would likely result if one or
                        several euro area countries were forced to (re-)establish their own national
                        currencies.</p>

                                indications of the possible economic effects resulting from one
                                particular stylised downside scenario in the euro area. It assumes
                                that sovereign and banking stress in the euro area intensifies
                                significantly relative to that in the baseline projection, with
                                confidence and financial conditions deteriorating, intensifying
                                financial stress in the rest of the world. The scenario does not
                                allow for the exit of any member state from the euro area, which
                                would further deepen the economic impact.</p>

                                widespread financial market contagion that could result, the 2008-09
                                crisis provides a basis for calibrating possible developments in the
                                downside scenarios. In particular, the deterioration in credit
                                conditions, corporate bond spreads and equity prices between the
                                latter half of 2007 (the half-year prior to the onset of a
                                generalised collapse in confidence) and the height of the crisis in
                                the first quarter of 2009 has been used to calibrate a benchmark for
                                the declines that could occur in major OECD economies in this
                                downside scenario. Thereafter, the reversion in these variables
                                towards more normal, pre-crisis levels is assumed to be protracted
                                compared with 2008-09, reflecting the more limited scope for sizable
                                support from conventional macroeconomic policies at the current
                                conjuncture. In addition, as discussed in the main text, long-term
                                government bond yields in this stylised scenario are also assumed to
                                rise by 300 basis points in the countries under greatest market
                                pressure in the euro area, broadly in line with past experience
                                following major changes in financial market sentiment.</p>
              <p id="ID48f336ea-81cf-41da-a91c-2bb6d55417b3" indent="y" numbering="n">A broad picture of the possible near-term outcomes and effects if
                                such a downside scenario were to occur is provided by simulations on
                                NiGEM, the global macroeconomic model of the National Institute of
                                Economic and Social Research. The model permits a full account to be
                                taken of the spillovers between countries arising from changes in
                                trade and international financial linkages via asset prices and net
                                foreign asset accumulation. However, it does not allow for possible
                                additional effects that might arise were private sector confidence
                                to plummet throughout the world.</p>

                                corporate bond spreads, household sector interest rate spreads,
                                equity prices and euro area bond yields are changed as set out
                                above. The simulations also incorporate a 40% decline in equity
                                prices (again reflecting the pattern of changes between the latter
                                half of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009) and the stylised rise of
                                300 basis points in long-term government bond rates in the countries
                                under greatest market pressure in the euro area. All shocks are
                                assumed, for simplicity, to persist fully for two years. Policy
                                interest rates are assumed to remain at their baseline settings
                                (close to the zero bound) and inflation expectations are held
                                constant. Budget solvency rules are turned off, so that the full
                                effect of the downturn is reflected in the automatic stabilisers in
                                all economies. Two sets of results are shown below. In the first,
                                the shocks are applied only to the euro area, with spillovers to
                                other countries primarily stemming from trade linkages. In the
                                second set of results, global financial contagion is incorporated as
                                well, magnifying the impact of the euro area shocks. </p>

                                a likely prolonged and increasingly deep recession in the euro area
                                in the absence of any discretionary counteracting policy responses,
                                with additional increases in unemployment adding to the already-high
                                social costs of adjustment in many countries. The OECD as a whole
                                would move into recession, with marked declines in activity in both
                                the United States and Japan, with the adverse impact of the euro
                                area shock on US activity rising considerably if it is accompanied
                                by global rather than localised financial market weakness. Business
                                investment would be particularly weak in the worldwide shock,
                                declining by around 20% over two years in the United States and
                                Japan, and by more than a quarter in the euro area. China and other
                                emerging market economies would not be immune from this shock, with
                                global trade volumes some 10 to 11% lower than baseline after two
                                years, and the value of their international asset holdings being hit
                                by weaker equity prices. </p>

                                would intensify, with deflation likely occurring in many OECD
                                economies by 2014, given the already low level of inflation in the
                                main projection and the gradual extent to which rising economic
                                slack generates disinflationary pressures. Unemployment would also
                                rise sharply, by over 2 percentage points in the OECD economies by
                                2014. If euro area governments made efforts to stick to their
                                announced fiscal objectives for the headline budget balance, the

                                2014. If such a policy was pursued, the large adverse multiplier
                                effects would intensify the adverse near-term effects on growth

                                In particular, the euro exchange rate could be expected to
                                depreciate, which would ease the adverse activity effects by the

                        long-term rates very low for a long period could delay necessary
                        deleveraging, prompt excessive risk taking and resource misallocation, and
                        also allow zombie banks and enterprises to survive. Furthermore, purchases
                        of private-sector assets might entail additional risks, such as greater
                        public concern about fairness and the increased vulnerability of central
                        bank balance sheets to asset price fluctuations. The materialisation of
                        these risks might eventually jeopardise public support for central bank
                        independence. Some of the risks could be contained by prudential policies
                        and stricter financial supervision (see below), and central banks could
                        prepare for possible losses on the purchased assets in co-operation with
                        governments, for example by raising net assets or obtaining guarantees
                        against the losses. Even so, in event of a severe downturn, the benefits
                        from expanded unconventional monetary policy measures would most likely be
                        higher than their potential future costs.</p>

          <p id="IDcfcbd5af-53f9-4ed2-bd99-257fc58008d6" indent="y" numbering="n">With the
                        recovery of economic activity projected to be weak and surrounded by
                        significant downside risks, fiscal policy decisions over the next two years
                        need to balance two main challenges. On the one hand, there is an urgent
                        need for a large majority of OECD countries to implement credible fiscal
                        consolidation programmes that put government finances on a sustainable path
                        and reduce financial vulnerabilities. At the same time, the pace of
                        consolidation must take into account the state of the economy and the
                        adverse effects of fiscal policies on aggregate demand, with fiscal
                        multipliers at present likely to be higher than in normal times (see above).
                        Thus, budgetary outcomes should be allowed to deviate from announced
                        consolidation plans if economic activity turns out to be temporarily weaker
                        than assumed, with the scope for deviation depending on fiscal positions and
                        market pressures. For countries with impaired public finances acting alone,
                        there is only limited scope to stretch out the path of consolidation without
                        further losses to credibility in financial markets. However, it may be both
                        possible and desirable to let automatic stabilisers work around the
                        structural adjustment path as part of a more general and co-ordinated
                        approach. At the same time, there is some scope for fiscal easing or
                        postponement of structural adjustment in countries with relatively healthy
                        public finances. In particular, there would be a need to temporarily ease
                        fiscal tightening or even provide fiscal stimulus if serious downside risks
                        materialise. The projection discussed above is based on the assumption that,
                        where announced, consolidation plans will be implemented in structural terms
                        in all countries, but not necessarily in nominal terms.</p>

                                remains uncertain. Current legislation still implies an extremely
                                sharp fiscal tightening in 2013, amounting to close to 4% of GDP,
                                with the extensions of the 2001-03 tax cuts set to expire and
                                automatic expenditure reductions set to be implemented, lowering GDP
                                growth by at least 2 percentage points compared with the projection
                                (CBO, 2012). Thus, there remains an urgent need to avert a potential
                                sharp negative shock and remove risks that would undermine private
                                spending. At the same time, the constitutional debt ceiling needs to
                                be raised in a timely and orderly way to avoid serious disruptions.
                                The assumption adopted here is that a bipartisan agreement in
                                Congress brings about fiscal consolidation amounting to 1½ per cent
                                of GDP in 2013. Against the background of very large consolidation
                                needs, and with the economy projected to strengthen further,
                                consolidation amounting to 1½ per cent of GDP would appear to be
                                justified, and has been assumed, in 2014. However, if downside or
                                upside risks materialise, the automatic stabilisers should be
                                allowed to work fully. Potentially adverse reactions in financial
                                markets would be reduced if political stalemate on the appropriate
                                design of the needed medium and long-term fiscal retrenchment could
                                be overcome. It is in any case necessary to establish agreed
                                detailed medium-term consolidation plans to maintain confidence in
                                fiscal probity and thereby avoid the risk of destabilising increases

                                primary deficit is projected to decline in 2013 by ½ per cent of
                                GDP, with the headline deficit increasing to around 10% of GDP. In
                                2014 the underlying primary balance is projected to strengthen very
                                substantially, by 2½ per cent of GDP, mainly due to the increase in
                                the consumption tax rate and a freeze in non-reconstruction spending
                                by the central government in fiscal year (FY) 2013-14. While in
                                itself such abrupt tightening may seem undesirable, this should be
                                seen as a step towards Japan meeting its FY 2015 target of bringing
                                the primary budget deficit of local and central governments,
                                excluding reconstruction spending, to 3.2% of GDP. However,
                                additional measures are required to attain the long-term goals of
                                achieving a primary budget surplus by FY 2020 and putting the public
                                debt ratio on a downward path from FY 2021. Given the risks

                                programme needs to be established. High indebtedness limits the room

                        euro area, fiscal policy is set to be very tight in the current and coming
                        years in the countries under market pressure. Fiscal consolidation in 2013
                        and 2014 combined is largest in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain,
                        totalling 3¼, 3¾, 4½ and 3¼ percentage points respectively. Fiscal
                        consolidation plans have been reinforced by new consolidation measures,
                        mostly on the spending side, in some of the programme countries in order to
                        meet deficit targets against lower growth prospects (<xref refid="ID5850c587-fd9e-4300-8a79-d8bf3899bba5" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). These measures
                        will create additional headwinds to activity in the short run. Such
                        pro-cyclical fiscal tightening is in principle undesirable, but each
                        programme country has, on its own, little room for manoeuvre. Moreover, the
                        weak growth that is projected in the OECD’s baseline scenario undercuts the
                        growth assumptions embedded in the current consolidation programmes of many
                        other European countries, notably the national Stability and Convergence
                        Programmes presented at the level of the European Union. In this
                        environment, it would be appropriate for the economies in the euro area to
                        consolidate in line with the improvement in underlying balances embedded in
                        current programmes while taking no action to offset budgetary shortfalls
                        arising from weaker economic activity than assumed in current plans. This
                        departure from current nominal plans should be agreed at the level of the
                        European Union for all countries concerned; a series of separate national
                        announcements would be much more likely to trigger adverse market reactions.
                        In a number of countries, including Portugal and Spain, nominal
                        consolidation targets have already been revised, in agreement with the
                        European Commission, amid the economies’ deep recession and shortfalls in

                                general government deficit of 3% in 2014. Similarly, in Spain, the
                                targets were relaxed by 1 and 1.5 percentage points for 2012 and

                        France must seize the opportunity of the initial phase of a new government
                        mandate to launch a comprehensive medium-term strategy of fiscal
                        consolidation and structural reforms that would boost confidence and raise
                        competitiveness and growth. In the event that serious downside risks
                        materialise in the euro area, countries with relatively robust fiscal
                        positions should give a temporary discretionary fiscal stimulus to demand,
                        implying either declines in underlying net lending (including Germany and
                        Finland) or tempering planned reduction in underlying deficits (including
                        France and Belgium), while other euro area countries (including Italy, Spain
                        and the EU/IMF programme countries) would only be in a position to allow
                        automatic stabilisers to work.</p>

                        Continued consolidation is increasingly being challenged on the grounds that
                        spending cuts and tax increases are considered inequitable, highlighting the
                        need for fiscal retrenchment to be seen as being fair. Indeed, some of the
                        most frequently employed consolidation instruments tend to widen the static
                        income distribution if not designed carefully (OECD, 2012h). This applies in
                        particular to spending on welfare, pensions, health care and education and
                        to consumption taxes. Concerns about equity impacts have already prompted
                        changes in the composition of consolidation. For example, in France a shift
                        has taken place from spending restraint and indirect tax increases to income
                        tax increases, in particular for higher incomes. In Portugal, the government
                        has had to revise consolidation measures so as to avoid raising employees’
                        social security contributions. These changes reflect the necessity for
                        balancing the immediate impact of consolidation on the distribution of
                        income and its effect on growth in the long term. Some consolidation
                        instruments, notably reducing distortionary tax shelters that benefit
                        high-income and wealthy individuals, could be employed more extensively to
                        achieve a fair, growth-friendly consolidation. However, such instruments
                        apart, it is a challenge to calibrate the composition of policy packages so
                        as to attain the best balance between near-term activity, long-term
                        efficiency and equity objectives (<xref refid="ID8d471ed1-0b66-45d7-aa54-35cbba3d496d" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).</p>

                                the progressivity of each instrument, the weight of each instrument
                                in the tax and transfer system and the overall size of the tax and
                                transfer system. Thus, governments can exercise a certain degree of
                                discretion about the redistributive impact of their consolidation
                                strategies by choosing particular combinations of spending
                                reductions and revenue increases, or by changing the progressivity
                                and size mix of transfers and taxes.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1282889" indent="y" numbering="n">This is illustrated by
                                the redistributive impact of two polar consolidation strategies. For
                                both strategies it is assumed that the government targets a deficit
                                reduction of 3% of GDP. The first strategy relies entirely on
                                raising  direct   household   taxes   and   the   second   on 
                                 cutting    cash    transfers    to    households.   The   exercise 
                                 is based on the size and progressivity of taxes and transfers as of
                                the late 2000s (see Joumard <emphasis emph="italic">et
                                    al.</emphasis>, 2012). It is assumed that the change in taxes
                                and transfers is proportional across all deciles in each of the two
                                calculations and that market income is not affected. More generally,
                                no behavioural response is considered. As the example shows (see
                                figure below), the required tax increases reduce income inequality,
                                measured by the Gini coefficient, in all OECD countries, although to
                                varying degrees. Similarly, if the same consolidation outcome is to
                                be achieved via reductions in transfers, inequality increases in all
                                countries, to different degrees and with absolute changes in
                                inequality usually higher than in the case of tax increases.
                                Cross-country differences in impacts reflect pre-existing
                                differences in the progressivity of individual instruments and in
                                their relative size. Any combination of changes in taxes on the one

                                transfers can be designed and supplemented by structural measures in
                                a way that minimises adverse distributive impacts or even avoids
                                them entirely, though possibly at the price of a delay in
                                consolidation. In particular, raising the effective retirement age
                                would be a preferential consolidation measure, as it will increase
                                labour force participation and thus boost income for some persons
                                who otherwise would have received a pension instead, but will
                                produce budgetary savings only very gradually. Reform in the
                                education and health care systems should also rank high on the
                                policy agenda in that it can produce large consolidation gains
                                without compromising equity or service quality. However, such reform
                                would require meticulous programme planning and implementation to be
                                effective and avoid disadvantaging the less well-off. Cuts in
                                unemployment-related benefits and disability benefits would likely
                                hit poorer people in the first place, especially if weak economic
                                activity prevents an offsetting rise in employment. However, if
                                designed properly and supplemented with coherent activation
                                strategies, such adverse effects can be offset by higher employment
                                once the economy adjusts.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1283173" indent="y" numbering="n"> On the revenue side,
                                cutting certain tax expenditures can increase both equity and
                                economic growth and should be given high priority. Higher taxation
                                of immovable property, which is taxed at a lower rate than other
                                assets in most countries, appears broadly consistent with equity
                                objectives and belongs to the tax increases that are least harmful
                                to long-term growth. However, to be effective, additional measures
                                might be needed that could increase near-term administrative costs,
                                such as proper valuation of property. Raising other property taxes
                                would be beneficial for equity, although potentially at the cost of
                                negative growth effects. Increasing consumption taxes would be
                                regressive from the perspective of the static income distribution,
                                although much less so from a lifetime perspective as over their
                                lifetime people spend more of what they earn. If increases are
                                broadly based, little damage might be done to lifetime income equity
                                and growth. Higher capital income taxes would be positive for
                                equity. They can be distortive with respect to growth, but are more
                                worth considering when capital income is taxed at a significantly
                                lower rate than labour income. Raising labour income taxes can
                                enhance equity in the short run, but would likely reduce growth in
                                the long run.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The gradual recovery is continuing. Activity has been expanding
                        at a pace just slightly ahead of potential, while the labour market has
                        recovered very slowly. The housing market has shown signs of a turnaround,
                        but its contribution to overall GDP growth remains small. Faced with these
                        developments, the Federal Reserve announced in September that it would take
                        further measures to sustain the upturn through a new round of long-term
                        asset purchases, and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain at
                        exceptionally low levels at least through mid-2015. Nevertheless, given the
                        substantial fiscal drag still ahead, output is projected to expand only
                        moderately next year and pick up slowly thereafter.</emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Reducing the large federal budget deficit is necessary to
                        restore fiscal sustainability, but this should be done gradually and in the
                        context of a well identified medium-term consolidation plan. It is thus
                        essential that current legislation be amended to smooth the implementation
                        of tax increases and spending cuts and to raise the debt ceiling in an
                        orderly manner. Given the low levels of resource utilisation, monetary
                        policy can remain accommodative for an extended period, provided that
                        inflation expectations stay well anchored. </emphasis>

                        business investment softened noticeably, likely owing to caution in the face
                        of uncertainty about the US fiscal outlook and developments in Europe, as
                        suggested by weak business confidence indicators. By contrast, household
                        confidence has been relatively buoyant, moving up close to its pre-recession
                        average. GDP growth in the second half of this year will be held back by
                        drought-related losses in farm output and disruptions related to Hurricane
                        Sandy, but these effects should be reversed early next year.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The increase in the consumption tax rate from 5% to 10% by 2015,
                        combined with spending restraint, should enable Japan to achieve its
                        objective of halving its primary budget deficit to 3.2% in FY 2015, with
                        much of the consolidation occurring in 2014. With gross public debt
                        projected to reach 230% of GDP in 2014, additional measures to attain a
                        primary budget surplus by FY 2020 as intended are a priority. A detailed and
                        credible fiscal consolidation plan, including specific revenue increases and
                        spending cuts, is essential to sustain confidence in Japan’s public
                        finances. The Bank of Japan has steadily expanded its asset purchase
                        programme to 19% of GDP by October 2012. It should maintain its virtually
                        zero interest rate policy and continue increasing quantitative measures
                        until inflation is firmly positive at its target rate of 1%.</emphasis>

                        expansion has been underpinned by the 17 trillion yen (3.6% of GDP)
                        allocated for public reconstruction spending. Such spending, though, is
                        expected to peak in 2012. Although planned tax increases over the next
                        25 years, as well as spending cuts and non-tax revenues, will eventually
                        cover the cost, reconstruction outlays are exacerbating the current fiscal
                        predicament. The budget deficit is projected to remain close to 10% of GDP
                        (excluding one-off factors) in 2012-13, pushing public debt further into
                        uncharted territory. </p>

                        August 2012, the Diet approved a hike in the consumption tax rate in two
                        stages, from 5% to 8% in April 2014, and to 10% in October 2015, conditional
                        on an improvement in economic conditions. The additional revenue will partly
                        go to financing swelling social spending due to population ageing and partly
                        to reducing the budget deficit. Combined with ongoing spending restraint,
                        the government may achieve a consolidation of more than 2% of GDP in 2014,
                        enabling it to meet its objective of halving the primary budget deficit (for
                        central and local governments, excluding reconstruction spending) from 6.4%
                        of GDP in FY 2010 to 3.2% in FY 2015. However, additional measures are
                        needed to achieve the government’s goals of a primary budget surplus by
                        FY 2020 and putting the public debt ratio on a downward trend from FY 2021.
                        The large increase in the consumption tax rate is welcome, but is just a
                        first step to restore fiscal sustainability.</p>

                        ratio. Deflationary pressures are also likely to remain headwinds for growth
                        through 2014. </p>

                        which is projected to persist into the early part of 2013. Growth is
                        projected to pick up only slowly during 2013 and into 2014. On-going fiscal
                        consolidation will hold back activity, but private demand will pick up as
                        confidence and the functioning of the financial sector improve. Continued
                        high unemployment and a large margin of excess capacity will depress
                        inflationary pressures. The main risk is a lack of sufficient progress by

                        reduce the adverse feedback loop between sovereigns and the banking system.
                        Vulnerable economies should enter the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transaction
                        (OMT) programme if needed. To support demand, the ECB should reduce interest
                        rates further and issue forward guidance on maintaining the accommodative

                        implement fiscal consolidation measures as planned, but if activity weakens
                        more than expected in their fiscal programmes they should allow the
                        automatic stabilisers to work. To avoid loss of credibility for individual
                        countries acting alone, this should be announced in co-ordination.
                        Structural reforms are essential in both debtor and creditor economies to
                        boost growth and rebalance their economies. The EU Single Market should be

                        projection assumes that all euro area countries reach their fiscal
                        consolidation targets in terms of the structural deficit. Should growth fall
                        short of what is assumed in budget plans, the automatic stabilisers should
                        be allowed to work around the structural consolidation path, implying that
                        headline deficit targets would be missed. If serious downside risks
                        materialise, countries with fiscal space should engage in temporary
                        discretionary stimulus.</p>

                        growth is projected to increase unemployment rates from their high levels.
                        The large margin of excess capacity will put downward pressure on underlying
                        inflation, while headline inflation is also set to fall in the near term as
                        the effect of past energy price increases dissipates. Weak inflationary
                        pressures and on-going financial market tensions warrant a further reduction
                        in monetary policy rates. Moreover, the ECB should issue forward guidance
                        that, subject to growth and inflation developments, it will hold rates low
                        for a long period. If downside risks materialise, further non-standard

                        efforts, ECB action and more serious problems elsewhere in the euro area
                        have helped to reduce the cost of debt financing. Implementing broad
                        structural reforms covering education and product and labour markets would
                        help maintain confidence and strengthen France’s economic prospects. There
                        is also ample room to rebalance the tax structure by lowering social
                        contributions, eliminating inefficient tax expenditures and increasing
                        property, inheritance and environmental taxes. The recently announced
                        Competitiveness Pact is an important first step in this direction and would
                        support job creation, investment and exports as of 2014.</p>

                        reforms and fiscal consolidation is well underway. Nonetheless, the economy
                        is projected to continue contracting in the short term, reflecting budgetary
                        tightening, weak confidence and tight credit supply. Weak growth will put
                        further downward pressure on employment, wages and consumer prices. With
                        gradual improvements in competitiveness, confidence and financial
                        conditions, the economy is projected to return to growth during

                        fiscal targets of structural balance in 2013 and 2014. However, as these
                        growth projections are weaker than the government’s, the deficit rises
                        through the projection period. Should the OECD projection be realised,
                        further fiscal tightening in 2014 would be necessary to achieve the planned
                        debt reduction path. The reforms of the product and labour markets which
                        parliament has adopted over the past twelve months are impressive but must

                        the large fall in output over the past year, employment has stayed
                        remarkably robust so far, although unemployment has risen on account of
                        higher participation. Continued economic weakness is projected to raise the
                        unemployment rate to close to 12% by 2014. This will slow wage growth and
                        reduce consumer price inflation. This improvement in competitiveness will,
                        over time, boost exports.</p>

                        major source of uncertainty relates to the commitment of the post-April 2013
                        government to maintain the course on fiscal consolidation and
                        growth-friendly structural reforms. Backing off either would damage market
                        sentiment and growth. Another risk is that the fiscal balance improves less
                        than projected in 2012, despite measures introduced in the second half of
                        the year. Furthermore, an intensification of financial stress and unduly
                        rapid bank deleveraging might accentuate the credit squeeze and further damp
                        growth. On the upside, the improvement in the orientation of structural
                        policies may lift confidence, investment and labour market performance
                        earlier than envisaged.</p>

                        fiscal retrenchment and private deleveraging are generating headwinds for
                        the economy. Output remains about 3% below its pre-crisis peak. Growth is
                        projected to recover gradually and gain momentum towards the end of 2013, as
                        exports and household spending pick up as confidence recovers. Although
                        employment grew strongly in 2012, unemployment is expected to rise slightly
                        in 2013, as the subdued recovery and continued uncertainty may make firms

          <emphasis emph="bold">The Bank of England is providing significant support to the
                        economy through quantitative easing, which should continue. With the fiscal
                        deficit and public debt still high, the policy of fiscal consolidation
                        remains appropriate to ensure the sustainability of the public finances. In
                        the event of lower than expected growth, the flexibility of the fiscal
                        mandate should be utilised to allow the automatic stabilisers to continue to
                        operate, even though this may imply pushing out the debt target. The strong
                        institutional framework and medium-term structural consolidation plans
                        should be maintained to ensure credibility. The governments’ fiscal plans
                        allow reprioritising spending to focus further on long-term growth enhancing
                        infrastructure investment. Recent and planned structural reforms, especially
                        on planning and work incentives, should boost growth over

                        consolidation, continue to drag down growth. The sharp depreciation of

                        exports by as much as expected, as the euro area has fallen back into
                        recession. Weak demand and confidence, tight credit conditions and the bleak
                        world economy translate into low investment. Household deleveraging, and
                        income gains that have been eroded by inflation, have weighed on household
                        spending. The considerable slack in the economy is projected to keep

                        government debt at over 80% of GDP, fiscal consolidation is necessary to
                        restore the sustainability of public finances and will strengthen
                        medium-term growth prospects. The fiscal stance remains appropriate, and is
                        supported by the strong institutional framework. The flexibility of the
                        fiscal framework should be utilised if growth significantly underperforms
                        expectations. With clear plans for medium-term fiscal consolidation in
                        place, the fiscal mandate allows automatic stabilisers to play and
                        potentially leaves room for changing the composition of expenditure to focus

                        policy rate at 0.5% and quantitative easing at £375 billion (25% of GDP),
                        monetary policy is appropriately providing strong support to the economy.
                        The Funding for Lending Scheme in place since July 2012 is expected to
                        provide incentives to banks to increase domestic lending through cheap
                        funding. Reserve and collateral requirements have also been reduced to
                        increase credit supply. However, constrained aggregate demand and house
                        price uncertainty continue to limit credit demand.</p>

                        growth has been broadly flat over the past year, but strong headline growth
                        in the third quarter of 2012 was consistent with moderate underlying
                        expansion. Real GDP growth is projected to rise gradually during 2013 as
                        falling inflation boosts purchasing power and private consumption, and a
                        brighter international environment supports exports and investment.
                        Notwithstanding strong employment growth in 2012, unemployment is expected
                        to rise slightly to 8.3% in 2013 owing to the subdued recovery and high

                        likely to remain only moderate until mid-2013. Housing investment and house
                        prices are set to cool somewhat in response to tighter mortgage rules to
                        prevent households from becoming over-extended. The public sector is
                        consolidating, and exports are being held back by poor competitiveness and
                        weak global growth. Business investment should remain relatively strong,
                        however, thanks to global demand for natural resources, low capital costs
                        and corporate tax rates, and the high exchange rate, which is reducing the

                        However, economic slack is not large, so that a shift toward a tightening
                        stance by the latter half of 2013 may be needed. If housing-market
                        imbalances worsen, the government should respond with further
                        macro-prudential measures. Federal and provincial budget consolidation is

                        rate. This reflected a softening of commodity prices, which curtailed
                        profits and investments in the fast-growing resource sectors. The strength
                        of the housing market, which had been hardly interrupted at all during the
                        global economic and financial crisis, has by most measures started to
                        diminish following recent regulatory tightening of mortgage lending terms.
                        Tight budgets have also begun to kick in. At the same time, the high
                        Canadian dollar and ongoing global weakness have undermined exports and
                        manufacturing in particular. Employment growth has held up well, however,
                        and remained concentrated in full-time work, although productivity gains
                        have been correspondingly small. The main growth driver is expected to
                        continue to be non-housing investment, given highly favourable financial

                        the small weight (16%) of food in the Canadian consumer basket. Inflation is
                        projected to rise to near 2% by the end of the projection horizon, as slack

                        governments appear to be on track to achieving their medium-term targets,
                        although with a slight delay because of slower economic growth. The federal
                        government is seeking to return to surplus by 2016-17, one year later than
                        initially budgeted, while Ontario intends to move from a deficit of 2.2% of
                        provincial GDP to a small surplus by 2017-18. Most of the federal and
                        provincial adjustments are taking place on the spending side. Federal direct
                        programme spending will be virtually frozen in real terms over the five-year
                        planning period and federal employment will fall by nearly 5%. Provinces
                        with large structural deficits will face a more difficult task. The Ontario
                        government has negotiated two-year pay freezes with 10 000 public service
                        managers and the province’s 25 000 doctors, and is pursuing similar
                        agreements with teachers and other unionised public sector workers. Public
                        sector spending restraint at all levels will be a significant drag on growth
                        but is necessary to bring the government’s spending share of GDP back to
                        pre-crisis levels and to put public debt back on a sustainable path.</p>

                        output gap is the smallest in the G7 countries. Hence, above-trend growth
                        could cause inflation pressures to re-emerge. The Bank of Canada has
                        indicated that some withdrawal of the currently considerable policy stimulus
                        may become appropriate to ensure the medium-term inflation target of 2%.
                        Signs of stress in household balance sheets following the prolonged period
                        of low interest rates are also a matter of policy concern. Given the central
                        projection, the Bank should begin to tighten in the latter half of 2013.</p>

                        outpaced by labour force growth, leading to a moderate increase in the
                        unemployment rate to 4.4% in September, slightly above its estimated
                        structural level. With activity likely to stay weak in the near term,
                        employment growth is expected to slow down and unemployment to rise further.
                        Inflation abated from the high levels in 2011 as it is no longer affected by
                        indirect tax increases, and is projected to decline further as spare
                        capacity increases. Gains in real disposable income in 2012 should support
                        consumption once confidence improves. Financing conditions are also
                        supportive as banks have passed on low funding costs to customers without
                        significantly tightening lending conditions. But credit demand remains
                        moderate, likely reflecting high uncertainty about the recovery.</p>

                        sufficiently to more readily address possible adverse developments. It would
                        also be appropriate to expand the recently introduced cash transfers for the

                        ½ per cent of GDP, although the structural deficit would remain at 1%. While
                        this is consistent with the government achieving its objective, further

                        balance for 2013, and especially, for 2014 due to weaker projected growth
                        and the assumed operation of the automatic stabilisers. The projections

                        structural reforms take effect, growth is projected to pick up after that. A

                        will continue to fall over the projection period, given the substantial
                        economic slack and very high unemployment. The current account deficit,
                        which narrowed in 2012 partly due to the write-down of private debt, is
                        likely to decline further to around 2¼ per cent of GDP in 2014.</p>

                        is being led by private consumption, which has been boosted by debt
                        write-downs and high wage settlements, and by residential and business
                        investment. While household balance sheets have improved, firms are still
                        deleveraging. The central bank has started to withdraw monetary policy
                        accommodation, but its policy rate is still low after adjusting for
                        inflation. The unemployment rate fell to 5.7% in the third quarter of 2012,
                        partly owing to a temporary programme to employ long-term unemployed
                        persons. Following large collective wage increases at the end of 2011, wage
                        growth has slowed and is likely to continue doing so. Inflation has fallen
                        sharply, as the effects of the earlier increase in commodity prices and
                        exchange rate depreciation pass, but remains well above the central bank’s
                        2.5% target.</p>

                        in real GDP stopped slowing in the first half of this year. However,
                        anticipation of a VAT hike in September is likely to have temporarily
                        boosted private consumption, implying that underlying growth in demand was
                        somewhat weaker. In addition, indicators point to slower growth in the
                        second half of 2012. Consumer price inflation remains well within the target
                        band (1% to 3%) despite energy and food price hikes. Also, inflation
                        expectations have dipped recently and are close to the centre of the band.
                        However, house prices have picked up. The policy interest rate was reduced
                        by 25 basis points to 2% in November, the fifth cut since September 2011.
                        The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by around 5% between May and
                        August, but this has since been partially reversed. The Bank of Israel has
                        not intervened in the foreign-currency market since the extreme highs in the

                        intensified tax collection. Agreement on a 2013 budget has been postponed

                        in 2011, one of the highest in the OECD. Slower growth helped to reduce

                        growth is projected to reach 4½ per cent by 2014, driven by exports as world
                        trade rebounds. Korea is well placed to gain market share in global markets,
                        given the recent implementation of free trade agreements with the United
                        States and European Union and the low value of the won, which is about
                        one-fifth below its 2007 level in real effective terms. However, private
                        consumption faces headwinds due to the high level of household debt. In
                        addition, wage gains will be constrained by the large number of older
                        workers seeking employment, as the first wave of the baby boomers reach
                        age 57 in 2012, the average mandatory retirement age set by firms for their

                        growth slowed in 2012 as weak foreign demand and persistent strength in the
                        exchange rate depressed exports. Business confidence has slid, and
                        unemployment has risen. Sluggish real household income growth and high debt
                        loads have pared consumer spending. Currency appreciation and falling world
                        commodity prices have pushed headline and underlying inflation below 1%.
                        Meanwhile, low interest rates have supported business investment and allowed
                        households to deleverage through faster mortgage repayments. Reconstruction
                        from the 2010-11 earthquakes is beginning to gather momentum, and the
                        housing market has shown signs of firming. Credit growth has also risen in
                        the agriculture sector, benefiting from the recent rebound in dairy
                        prices.</p>

                        However, with little excess capacity in some sectors and strong demand for
                        housing, overall investment demand will remain quite strong. Sustained real

                        growth and private consumption growth is projected to pick up to around
                        4½ per cent in 2013 and 2014. Much of the additional labour demand is
                        expected to be met from further immigration, which will probably also be a
                        significant source of demand for housing. Mainland GDP will thus remain
                        strong, with only a slight decline in the growth rate after 2012, while
                        overall GDP will slow rather faster in line with the secular decline in
                        petroleum output.</p>

                        strength of demand, inflation could rise more rapidly than in these
                        projections, but it has been persistently below expectations for some time
                        and could equally continue to surprise on the downside.</p>

                        growth is projected to fall from 4.3% in 2011 to below 2% in 2013, due to
                        the weak European economy and fiscal retrenchment. The fiscal tightening
                        reflects in part lower public investment as the flow of EU funds is set to
                        plateau. A deteriorating labour market and a rising saving rate will
                        restrain private consumption. A gradual recovery is projected to start in
                        the second half of 2013 with real GDP growth reaching some 3% through 2014.
                        The unemployment rate could rise to about 11% at the end of 2014, which

                        Private consumption is likely to remain subdued due to the weak labour

                        the growth of public debt and ensuring fiscal sustainability require strong
                        fiscal consolidation. Despite the cyclical deterioration, the government is

                        from almost 5% in 2011. This consolidation effort is to be mainly achieved
                        by revenue increases (including the enlargement of the size of the first
                        pension pillar financed by the reduction in the share of social security
                        contributions put into pension funds). Public spending is also to be
                        contained (including by freezing public wages and restraining public
                        consumption and investment). In 2014, the pace of consolidation will ease,
                        and the deficit is projected to fall to 2.4% of GDP. </p>

                        adopting an ambitious fiscal consolidation package in April 2012, in the
                        wake of a larger-than-anticipated budget deficit in 2011 and amid severe
                        tensions in the sovereign bond market, the government has proposed
                        additional consolidation measures going forward. On the spending side, they
                        involve lowering the public sector wage bill further, through cuts in public
                        sector wages and headcount, and in social transfers, including unemployment
                        benefits. Measures to boost revenues include raising intermediate VAT rates
                        for some goods and services, the introduction of a financial transaction tax
                        on commissions on services provided by financial institutions, an extension

                        some income tax exemptions and tax credits. These additional measures to
                        meet nominal fiscal targets are projected to further weigh on aggregate
                        demand. The authorities also need to put public finances on a sustainable
                        footing in the medium term, notably with a comprehensive pension reform,

                        sizable deterioration in the quality of Slovenian banks’ asset portfolios is
                        a major concern. It is undermining credit growth and becoming a major
                        obstacle to economic expansion. To stabilise the banking sector the
                        government introduced legislation in October 2012 setting up a Bank Asset
                        Management Company (BAMC), which is to take over problem loans from
                        systemically important financial institutions. The authorities should ensure
                        that asset transfers are transparent and consistent with international best
                        practices. According to official plans, the BAMC will issue
                        government-guaranteed bonds of up to EUR 4 billion (11% of GDP) in return
                        for the transfer of problem loans; additional capital injections are
                        envisaged to cost around 1.3-2.7% of GDP. (The OECD projections do not
                        incorporate a corresponding worsening of the public finances.) The
                        legislation, however, faces considerable opposition, notably from the social
                        partners, and may face a referendum. </p>

                        European growth. Labour market conditions have been bleak: employment has
                        contracted rapidly and the unemployment rate has risen above 25%. However,

                        around 2.7% of GDP in 2013 and 1% in 2014. As a result, the headline deficit
                        is projected to decline. However, it will exceed the targets due to weak
                        economic growth, including in 2012. Fiscal consolidation is expected to have
                        stronger than usual effects on growth in this credit-constrained
                        environment, which militates against taking further measures to hit headline

                        pick-up in the euro area, a mild recovery is expected to take hold in 2014.
                        There are significant risks around the projection on both sides. On the
                        downside, further turbulence elsewhere in the euro zone may lead to higher
                        sovereign and bank borrowing costs, and to weaker trading partner growth,
                        aggravating the recession and the fiscal deficit in Spain. Trying to
                        counter-act this with additional fiscal measures would further hit

                        external environment and weakening household confidence as unemployment
                        increased and house prices fell. From mid-2013, however, growth is projected
                        to pick up to beyond its potential rate. The unemployment rate is projected
                        to begin to fall, although remaining spare capacity should keep inflation at
                        low rates.</emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The macroeconomic policy stance is appropriate, but the scope
                        for more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies should be used if growth
                        proves to be weaker than expected. To avoid unemployment becoming
                        entrenched, the government should continue its efforts to lower the relative
                        labour cost for groups at risk. </emphasis>

                        growth is projected to pick up again in the second half of 2013 on the back
                        of increases in private consumption and investment. The recovery in world
                        trade will also lead to a modest improvement in export growth. Nonetheless,
                        due to the continued strength of the franc, increases in imports are
                        expected to outpace export gains. Once growth picks up, the unemployment
                        rate should gradually decline. Policy interest rates should stay unchanged
                        over the projection period, consistent with the persistent economic slack
                        and minimal inflation.</p>

                        persistently high inflation. Growth is projected to regain momentum on the
                        back of recovering domestic demand, rising to around 4% in 2013 and
                        exceeding 5% in 2014. Inflation and the current account deficit are

                        announced reductions in energy costs should contain it for some time. </p>

                        this can be easily financed by capital inflows, including foreign direct

                        rate for over a decade. This reflects weak export market growth and the
                        effect on domestic demand of government measures to cool inflationary
                        pressures. This objective has now been achieved, including for property
                        prices, and the authorities have started to ease the stance of macroeconomic
                        policy. Going forward, the economy will still face external headwinds, but
                        housing and infrastructure outlays are likely to revert to their longer-term
                        trend. With domestic demand gathering renewed momentum, the current account
                        surplus is set to shrink to 2¼ per cent of GDP by 2014, compared with the
                        peak of 10% in 2007.</emphasis>

                        easing of the macroeconomic policy stance from around mid-2012, including
                        the central government’s encouragement to frontload infrastructure spending,
                        is set to support near-term growth. The underlying expansion in the demand
                        for housing is beginning to show through again and banks have been asked to
                        lower interest rates for first-time buyers. At the same time, outlays under
                        the government’s social housing programme have been growing. The pick-up in
                        business investment also seems likely to continue as market interest rates
                        fall and credit availability improves. However by past standards, export
                        growth is set to remain subdued. As a result, the upswing may be
                        moderately-paced by China’s past standards, with growth not exceeding 9%
                        during the next two years. Inflation seems likely to ease back further given
                        persistent slack, though there is considerable uncertainty about the pace at
                        which capacity is expanding.</p>

                        expected to remain weak for some time. The current account deficit has
                        narrowed as imports have softened on account of cooling domestic demand and
                        a weaker rupee. Inflation has temporarily been pushed up by hikes in
                        regulated petroleum prices but is expected to decline as spare capacity
                        mounts. This will create room for easing monetary policy, which has been
                        hindered by persistently high inflation and a widening fiscal
                        deficit.</emphasis>

                        sectors, including retail and aviation, have boosted business sentiment

                        term. The fiscal position has weakened as tax revenues have been hit by the
                        slowdown and spending has overshot. Spending restraint is needed to ensure
                        that fiscal slippage is limited and confidence does not suffer further on

                        (RBI). Recent high inflation partly reflects a hike in regulated diesel
                        prices in September which was necessary to reduce subsidies and financial

                        After cutting the repo rate earlier in the year the RBI has kept it
                        relatively high at 8%. However, the cash reserve ratio was lowered again in
                        September, by 25 basis points, bringing total reductions this year to 1.5
                        percentage points. This has eased liquidity pressures and reduced interbank
                        interest rates. The major commercial banks have cut lending costs
                        marginally, but credit growth remains subdued. Equity prices and sentiment
                        have been buoyed somewhat by recent moves to liberalise foreign direct
                        investment in aviation, retail and other sectors and by announcements that
                        barriers will be reduced in other areas.</p>

                        2013. Investment is also expected to pick up in response to a further
                        improvement in financial conditions, including an easing in monetary policy
                        made possible by cooling inflation. This will be supported by a boost in

                        inflation has followed developments in food prices, but there has been
                        little apparent impact from the currency depreciation. Looking forward,
                        tight labour markets and a sharp rise in the minimum wage in some provinces
                        will drive inflation back up somewhat. A 15% increase in electricity tariffs

                        Indonesia has been tightening monetary policy indirectly by increasing the

                        strengthened regulations on lending and banned the use of unsecured loans
                        for down payments for housing and vehicles. However, its inflation-fighting
                        credentials may have been harmed by its decision to raise the inflation
                        target for 2013 to 5%. Increases in the policy rate itself would signal to
                        markets that controlling inflation remains the central bank’s primary

                        undermined export volume growth and driven a softening of South Africa’s key
                        export commodity prices, resulting in a re-emergence of large current
                        account deficits.</p>

                        normal recovery, private spending, especially on investment, would be rising
                        strongly at this stage, but fears about global economic weakness and its
                        implications for South Africa have undermined confidence. Scope for fiscal
                        stimulus is limited, with a still-large structural budget deficit. Indeed,
                        the gradual consolidation of the fiscal position needs to continue, although
                        automatic stabilisers should be allowed to play if growth is slower than
                        expected. As to monetary policy, although the large wage increases seen in
                        some mining sector strike settlements are likely to put some near-term
                        upward pressure on wage demands in other sectors, there is still margin to
                        cut interest rates, as economic slack should restrain core inflation. </p>

            described in the main body of this report. Data for 2012 to 2014 are OECD estimates and
            projections. The data in some of the tables have been adjusted to conform to
            internationally agreed concepts and definitions in order to make them more comparable
            across countries, as well as consistent with historical data shown in other OECD
            publications. Regional aggregates are based on weights that change each period, with the
            weights depending on the series considered. For details on aggregation, see OECD

          <p id="ID-42-1062269" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD quarterly projections are on a
                    seasonal and working-day-adjusted basis for selected key variables. This implies
                    that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may occur, though
                    these in general are quite small. In some countries, official forecasts of
                    annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even when official
                    forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the adjustment may in some
                    cases differ from that used by the OECD. The cut-off date for information used
                    in the compilation of the projections is 15 November 2012.</p>
