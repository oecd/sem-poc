					ahead, but more risks</mainhead>
      </heading>
      <p id="IDa40bd995-637d-4cbc-bcd9-becc931f03ee" indent="n" numbering="n">The global
				economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, with some acceleration of growth
				anticipated in 2014 and 2015. But global growth forecasts have been revised down
				significantly for this year and 2014, in large part due to weaker prospects in many
				emerging market economies (EMEs). Downside risks dominate and policy must address
				them. </p>
      <p id="ID6b7f09e9-50b4-4865-8f42-ecf79c2628b3" indent="y" numbering="n">Contrary to the
				situation in the early phases of the recovery when stimulus in EMEs had positive
				spillovers on growth in advanced economies, the global environment may now act as an
				amplifier and a transmission mechanism for negative shocks from EMEs. </p>
      <p id="IDc243dddf-8f57-4d5a-82d5-2b3be3e7622b" indent="y" numbering="n">In recent
				months, three events already have unsettled confidence and market stability, which
				accounts for part of the downgrading of our forecasts since the last <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>. First, the reaction to discussion in
				early summer regarding the tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve was
				surprisingly strong. Second, increased concerns about developments in some EMEs
				added to market tensions and sharp capital outflows. Third, the United States came
				close to a potentially catastrophic crisis associated with its legislative ceiling
				on federal government debt.</p>
      <p id="ID7d1f843a-06e6-42ce-b2c6-60ee617d40aa" indent="y" numbering="n">These events –
				recognised as risks in the May <emphasis emph="italic">Outlook</emphasis> –
				underline the prominence of negative scenarios and risks that the recovery could
				again be derailed. These episodes could easily be replayed, quite possibly in a more
				virulent form, in the period ahead. Other long-standing risks could return to the
				fore. Although some acute risks, especially in Europe, have receded, tensions within
				the euro area could erupt again. In addition, specific risks could interact with one
				another and magnify the effects. These risks stem from unresolved financial
				fragilities and imbalances, the cumulated effects of exceptional and prolonged
				monetary stimulus, and underlying structural weaknesses of growth trends in many
				countries, partly reflecting the consequences of a deep and long-lasting recession. </p>
      <p id="IDe0b2d3a5-ab96-48e1-b715-36b63c78513b" indent="y" numbering="n">A stronger
				slowdown in EMEs would lower growth in advanced economies, most notably in Europe
				and Japan. In many EMEs, growth is already decelerating. To a large degree, this is
				related to demographic trends and the diminishing scope for catch-up growth as the
				income gap with the advanced countries narrows, but there are also long-standing
				structural impediments that had been hidden by abundant capital inflows and credit
				growth but which have been exposed by the tightening of financial conditions. Such
				conditions could add to fragility within EMEs, particularly those most reliant on
				short-term capital flows or where credit growth has been very fast, and in those
				advanced economies that are financially exposed to them. While many EMEs are in a
				stronger position to withstand shocks than in the past, they must accelerate the
				pace of reforms to deal with deep-rooted fragilities. </p>
      <p id="ID324f0e3a-ed41-446f-a4ec-4db1064fff17" indent="y" numbering="n">In the United
				States, monetary policy needs to remain accommodative for some time, balancing
				uncertainty about the evolution of demand and employment with the costs of
				postponing exit. When economic growth strengthens, large-scale bond purchases should
				begin to be phased down and then, in the course of 2015, the Federal Reserve should
				start to raise policy interest rates towards a more neutral stance. </p>
      <p id="ID45398ce8-441b-48f0-9ca8-822486a4e0f4" indent="y" numbering="n">Brinkmanship
				over fiscal policy in the United States remains a key risk and uncertainty. As
				discussed in this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>, this creates
				on-going uncertainty and poor policy choices, while hitting the debt ceiling could
				knock the US and the global recovery off course. The debt ceiling needs to be
				scrapped and replaced by a credible long-term budgetary consolidation plan with
				solid political support. </p>
      <p id="ID2c2355a2-890f-4cb7-a125-cefe94d603d6" indent="y" numbering="n">In the euro
				area, recovery is lagging and uneven, unemployment – especially among the young –
				remains very high and inflationary pressures are very subdued. The ECB should
				consider further policy measures if deflationary risks become more serious. Current
				account adjustment is advancing in the periphery but price adjustment alone will not
				work given the impossibility of reconciling deflation, needed to regain
				competitiveness, and achieving nominal growth to support debt sustainability. Much
				less adjustment, if any, is taking place in surplus countries. More durable and
				symmetric adjustment is needed through reforms to labour and product markets,
				including liberalisation of services in Germany that would strengthen and rebalance
				demand. </p>
      <p id="ID024810b1-0433-49ba-a750-d8b7f445247c" indent="y" numbering="n">Weakness in the
				banking system remains a major drag on growth in the euro area. The Asset Quality
				Review and stress tests in 2014 must be implemented rigorously – and followed up by
				bank recapitalisation where needed – to restore the transmission of monetary policy,
				strengthen financial-system stability and get credit moving again to enhance the
				effectiveness of structural reforms and support growth. Failure to use this
				opportunity could impair confidence in European banks and sovereigns. There is
				progress towards banking union but the transition promises to be complex and
				delicate as the criteria and responsibility for regulation, supervision, and
				resolution of banks have to be clarified. </p>
      <p id="IDc0a788b0-4160-4027-9d2c-619bfe819260" indent="y" numbering="n">In Japan, the
				initial impact of new monetary, fiscal and structural policies has produced strong
				export growth, rising consumer spending and a rebound in business investment. The
				increase in the consumption tax rate to 8% is welcome and should be followed by a
				further hike as planned in 2015. However, high levels of public debt create risks in
				the absence of a more detailed and credible fiscal consolidation plan to achieve the
				target of a primary budget surplus by 2020. Most importantly, bold structural reform
				measures are needed to boost growth and maintain confidence in the three arrow
				strategy.</p>
      <p id="IDdc16a585-37d1-4bef-b392-eb1a710719c1" indent="y" numbering="n">Growth since the
				global crisis has been uneven and hesitant. Job creation has been even more
				disappointing. Clear and credible strategies are needed for how jobs and growth will
				be created, as the public finances continue to be restored and so that exceptional
				monetary policies are no longer needed to support demand. Such strategies require a
				strong commitment to structural reforms in advanced and emerging market economies
				alike. </p>
      <p id="ID76f413d3-5662-4691-8fd7-dbd5b8fa3021" indent="y" numbering="n">The gains from
				structural reform will accumulate over the longer term, but for some measures they
				can be achieved in a couple of years. And the benefits are larger when macroeconomic
				and financial conditions are stronger, although paradoxically this can be the time
				when it is hardest to make the political case for reform. As the recovery takes
				hold, policy makers need to resist the temptation to back off reforms, and instead
				take advantage of improved conditions to secure the recovery and move to a stronger
				trajectory for jobs and growth. More jobs would boost income and confidence, thus
				providing support for the reform process itself and upside, rather than downside,
				risks could materialise.</p>
      <p id="IDcdce32a4-bd94-4bfc-bbad-1dd4ed656187" indent="y" numbering="n">If, however, as
				the recovery strengthens, governments are complacent, and remain behind the curve,
				policy action will be too little too late. Policy inaction or mistakes could have
				much more severe consequences than the turbulence seen to date and jeopardise growth
				for years to come. </p>

          </heading>
          <p id="IDd83465f9-07cb-48de-ada4-3a604f1de694" indent="y" numbering="n">The
						global recovery remains modest and uneven, with continued divergence in
						activity developments both between and within advanced and emerging
						economies. Outcomes this year and near-term prospects appear a little weaker
						than had been expected in May, at the time of the previous <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>, with global GDP growth
						revised down by just under ½ percentage point both this year and in 2014 to
						2.7% and 3.6% respectively. Almost all of this reflects a further growth
						slowdown in the large emerging market economies (EMEs), which is tempering
						the pace of the recovery in the OECD economies. At the same time, downside
						risks have also risen once more. Long-standing sources of risk, such as
						fragilities in the euro area banking sector and the Japanese fiscal
						situation, have been augmented by new concerns, most notably the possibility
						of significant financial instability in advanced and, especially, EMEs
						during the exit from unconventional monetary policies in the United States,
						and potentially extreme adverse outcomes if political stalemate were to make
						the debt ceiling in the United States binding early next year. Provided
						these large adverse risks do not materialise, and uncertainty about
						macroeconomic policy settings subsides, continued support from accommodative
						monetary policies, the feed-through of past improvements in financial market
						conditions and a reduced drag from fiscal consolidation should allow global
						activity and world trade to strengthen gradually over 2014-15 (<xref refid="IDe00577a4-d5b7-4679-8754-b6cad1b3e878" object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref"/>). However, the pace of the
						recovery seems likely to remain modest, with the currently high OECD-wide
						unemployment rate declining by only ½ percentage point over the two years to
						7.4% by end-2015, and inflation projected to remain weak in many OECD
						economies and moderate only gradually in most EMEs.</p>

          <p id="IDb494ee11-4fd6-4ed7-a7f1-b52fa4c77eb3" indent="y" numbering="n">Economic
						policies need to provide support to demand, take account of the sizeable
						downside risks and correct past imbalances. Monetary policy will need to
						remain accommodative in most OECD economies over the next two years.
						However, in some economies, decisions will be required about the timing and
						speed at which monetary policy stimulus is reduced, balancing the need to
						support the recovery against the risks of unsettling inflation expectations
						and stoking asset price bubbles. For the United States and the United
						Kingdom, well anchored inflation expectations, ample spare capacity, and the
						predominance of global downside risks all imply that the current very
						accommodative policy rates are likely to remain appropriate for some time.
						Nevertheless, conditional on downside risks not materialising and receding
						gradually, and on the recoveries in these countries proceeding as projected
						here, it would be appropriate for the United States to consider increasing
						gradually policy rates in early 2015 and for the United Kingdom to do so
						later in the year, not least to contain possible pressures on asset prices.
						More substantive increases in policy rates may be required in both countries
						beyond the projection period to prevent anchored inflation expectations
						being put to the test. In contrast, in the euro area in the coming two
						years, the monetary policy stance should remain unchanged, provided
						disinflationary pressures do not intensify further, and strong quantitative
						and qualitative monetary easing should be implemented as planned in Japan.
						As already shown this year, the anticipation and actual start of the
						monetary stimulus withdrawal in the United States could have adverse global
						spillover effects, especially if it results in financial market instability.
						Emerging market economies are particularly vulnerable to shifts in investor
						sentiment and some will possibly come under pressure to raise interest rates
						at a time when the economy is weak. Possible turmoil in EMEs and its
						feedback to advanced economies would magnify the challenges of managing the
						exit.</p>

								rise to broader negative spillover effects on activity in the world
								economy as a whole. Moreover, with the six BRIICS now accounting for
								30% of world GDP (at PPP rates) and 15% of global equity markets,
								and other non-OECD countries comprising a further 12% of world GDP,
								a growth slowdown has larger effects on the global economy and OECD
								countries than in the past. This box considers spillovers that arise
								from trade and financial cross-border linkages. Other possible
								transmission channels, such as spillovers on business sentiment, may
								also be quite important, particularly in a more serious
								slowdown.</p>
              <p id="IDb9feee58-ba78-40d9-9352-d6c4a050ff6a" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD countries’ trade exposures (in gross or value-added terms) are
								largely to other OECD countries; but direct trade exposures to
								non-OECD countries have risen substantially over the past two
								decades. In 2012, gross merchandise exports from OECD economies to
								non-OECD countries amounted to around 6% of OECD GDP. However, trade
								linkages vary considerably across countries, with commodity
								producers and countries strongly linked in global value chains
								tending to have a higher share of exports to EMEs (see first figure
								below). Korea had the highest direct export exposure of the OECD
								countries, with goods exports in 2012 amounting to one-third of GDP.
								Estonia, Slovenia and Hungary also have relatively high exposures.
								Some of the BRIICS, as well as OECD economies such as Chile and
								Turkey, also have a sizeable exposure to the non-OECD economies,
								equivalent to 10% of GDP or more, by this measure. A sharp slowing
								in external demand could prove particularly problematic for
								countries such as Turkey and South Africa, with gross merchandise
								exports to non-OECD economies that are around 12% of GDP and current
								account deficits of around 6% of GDP. </p>
              <p id="ID790b489e-8f0e-4b2f-bba7-c29f656bf41c" indent="y" numbering="n">Gross export data are likely to overstate the economic importance
								of direct trade exposures, as the former typically have a high
								import content. OECD/WTO trade-in-value-added data allow for this,
								although the data are currently available only up to 2009. Using the
								value-added data for combined exports of goods and services, OECD
								exports to the non-OECD countries accounted for around 30% of total
								OECD value-added exports and 5% of OECD GDP in 2009. Cross-country
								differences in the extent of exposure are, however, not that
								different to those found using gross export data (see first figure
								below), with Korea and commodity-producing economies such as Chile
								and Australia having relatively high exposures in value-added terms.
								Amongst the large OECD economies, Japan and Germany have the highest
								direct exposures to the non-OECD economies, likely reflecting their
								relative specialisation in exports of capital goods, often to the
								foreign subsidiaries of domestic companies. </p>

								commodity prices, with adverse effects on the terms of trade of
								commodity exporters. This is particularly true of weaker growth in
								China, which accounts for around three-fifths of world iron ore
								imports, close to one-third of copper imports and 12% of crude oil
								imports. Incomes in Australia and Chile may be most exposed; the
								terms-of-trade in these economies have risen by almost 70 per cent
								over the past decade, reflecting both the rise in commodity prices
								and concurrent falls in prices of manufactured goods. Other emerging
								market economies that have benefited from past commodity price
								strength – such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa – would also
								suffer, potentially prolonging their growth slowdowns.<boxnoteref refid="IDd3b8b9ac-2d61-4043-8099-28b431a9c0b8" format="boxnoteref"/> Oil exporters would also be affected, with

								additional second-round effects that might result from a demand
								slowdown in the non-OECD economies can be obtained from simulations
								using NiGEM, the global macroeconomic model of the National
								Institute of Economic and Social Research. In the illustrative
								scenario shown here, there is a one-year decline of 2 percentage
								points in domestic demand growth in all the non-OECD economies apart
								from China. This scenario can be seen as an approximation of the hit
								to domestic demand in the non-OECD economies brought about by a
								higher term premium on long bond rates in the United States (as
								occurred this year) combined with an underlying slowing of growth
								due to domestic bottlenecks and rigidities in many non-OECD
								economies (though not China). </p>

								economies, with OECD GDP growth likely to decline by some 0.4
								percentage points in the first year, though the feedback on the
								United States is weak and smaller than spillovers to other OECD
								economies (see second figure below). In the simulations used here,
								policy interest rates and exchange rates are assumed to remain at
								their baseline settings. In practice, exchange rate adjustments
								could cushion the shock somewhat in the non-OECD economies, as well
								as in commodity producers such as Australia and Chile, but add to
								the shock in the major OECD economies.</p>
              <p id="IDc1be6e8c-f94f-447a-8fb2-73d41656075b" indent="y" numbering="n">Financial linkages would be likely to raise the impact of a growth
								slowdown in the EMEs still further. Globalisation of financial
								markets has helped to more than double the share of OECD
								international portfolio and direct investment assets held in the
								BRIICS from a decade earlier (for countries with available data),
								although the share remains relatively small, at around 5%. An
								orderly but generalised slowdown in the non-OECD economies would be
								likely to have adverse effects on asset values and also lower
								earnings from equity and foreign direct investments. Data for the
								United States show that the effect on corporate profits might be
								non-negligible, with over one-third of the profits of the
								majority-owned foreign affiliates of US parent companies coming from
								affiliates in non-OECD economies (including around 10% from
								affiliates located in the BRIICS).<boxnoteref refid="ID1c157ad8-f82c-4073-b749-ea5a40e593aa" format="boxnoteref"/> Overall, Korea has the highest

								Bank for International Settlements (BIS) data on foreign claims on a

								are higher than before the financial crisis in banks from a range of

								and some euro area economies.<sup>3 </sup>Amongst those countries
								for which these data are available, the exposures to EMEs of banks
								in Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Switzerland appear
								to be larger relative to GDP than those of banks in other OECD
								countries, but are in all cases small relative to bank assets (see

								returns and potentially even an increase in credit impairment,
								especially if financial sector vulnerabilities in the EMEs were to
								deepen the impact of the initial slowdown. This could add to
								problems facing the banking sector of lending countries in which
								banks are under-capitalised. If some of the more weakly capitalised
								banking sectors are exposed to large losses, banks could even cut
								back on new lending, thereby propagating the crisis. </p>
              <p id="IDb1eefc92-48b8-48c7-a40e-86180438a65d" indent="y" numbering="n">Overall, if risks materialise for EMEs individually, spillovers to
								most high-income economies are likely to be limited: even large
								emerging economies such as China and India account only for a
								relatively limited share of developed economies’ exports. Moreover,
								on a bilateral basis, only a relatively modest share of high-income
								economies’ external assets is held in the EMEs. However, in the
								event of a broader slowdown in the EMEs, brought about, for
								instance, by further capital outflows as the tapering of asset
								purchases begins in the United States, potentially sizeable
								spillover effects can occur in the OECD economies as well as in

								sheets resulting from strong asset price growth, improving labour
								market outcomes and substantive deleveraging (helped in the United
								States, by institutions conducive to debt write-downs). These forces
								should continue to support private consumption growth, with
								additional balance sheet adjustment taking place whilst saving
								ratios remain close to their current levels. In Japan, spending
								growth and the saving rate are likely to fluctuate during 2014 and
								2015, due to the planned increases in the consumption tax rate. In
								the euro area, outside of Germany, household demand is expected to
								remain much softer, reflecting a mix of weak income growth, high
								unemployment, declines in property values and debt deleveraging,
								which has yet to begin in some economies (<xref refid="IDcdfb68e2-245b-4400-ac23-c3c3aaa5771a" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref"/>). However, area-wide car
								sales and retail sales have both now started to increase and private
								consumption is expected to pick up slowly through 2014-15. That
								said, there is a risk that household saving ratios may turn out to
								be somewhat higher than assumed in the projections in some
								countries, such as the Netherlands, Spain and Italy, to counteract
								on-going balance sheet deterioration via declines in property
								values.</p>

								years, even allowing for soft demand growth, with investment growth
								only recently becoming positive in countries such as Japan, Germany
								and the United Kingdom. The reasons for this remain unclear, though
								survey and anecdotal evidence from business have pointed to factors
								such as the higher cost (or even unavailability) of capital
								post-crisis and policy uncertainty. However, the pre-conditions for
								stronger investment growth now appear more favourable, especially
								outside the euro area. Greater risk appetite, as reflected in
								stronger equity prices, has raised the availability of external
								finance, and the aggregate balance sheet position of the
								non-financial corporate sector has improved in some countries.
								Against this, the cost of borrowing has risen this year, reflecting
								the increases in long-term interest rates since May, with additional
								increases assumed to occur over the next two years (see <xref refid="ID4473990b-d5c1-44d4-a6ae-a04fbfb310f7" object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref"/>). Reflecting the return of
								risk appetite, improved financial conditions and an
								acceleration-type mechanism as final demand strengthens, in
								particular in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom,
								OECD-wide business investment growth is projected to pick up over
								the next two years. However, the share of business investment in GDP
								would still remain below longer-term norms, reflecting the long
								period of weak investment since the crisis began. Even so, there is
								a downside risk, especially if interest rates were to increase more
								sharply or demand growth were to be slower than projected. Prospects
								remain weaker in the euro area, outside Germany, than elsewhere,
								reflecting subdued final demand, less favourable balance sheet
								developments that may show up in debt repayment rather than capital
								spending, still high barriers to competition and continued financial
								fragmentation. Structural policy priorities in particular economies

								reaction in financial markets, points to significantly bleaker
								outcomes. In this scenario a one-year fiscal contraction of
								approximately 5% of GDP would be the minimum needed in the United
								States in order to obtain a balanced budget, reflecting the
								additional declines in activity brought about by the deterioration
								in financial conditions. A deep recession would result in the United
								States, with GDP contracting by around 6¾ per cent relative to
								baseline, the unemployment rate<emphasis emph="bold"> </emphasis>rising by almost 2½ percentage points and very strong
								disinflationary pressures (see second table below). The OECD as a
								whole would be in recession, with GDP declining by over 3 percentage
								points relative to baseline, and the euro area and Japan would both
								be close to or in recession.<boxnoteref refid="IDff8d8345-a680-4451-a8d9-a0ade65e4ad2" format="boxnoteref"/> Over 4½ million additional people would
								become unemployed in the United States, the euro area and Japan and
								well over 5 million in the OECD as a whole. The non-OECD economies
								would also suffer a sizeable hit, with global trade volumes over 5%
								lower than baseline, and the value of their international asset
								holdings being hit by weaker equity prices. If a worldwide increase
								in risk aversion were to occur – implying higher risk premia in all
								economies rather than just the United States – the adverse near-term
								effects on growth would be intensified significantly further.</p>

								could change the balance of the different activity effects for
								different economies somewhat. In particular, the US dollar exchange
								rate could be expected to depreciate, which would ease the adverse
								activity effects by raising the external competitiveness of US
								exporters, and also ease disinflationary pressures by raising import
								prices. In contrast, the adverse activity impacts and
								disinflationary effects would likely be higher in other economies,
								given the appreciation of their currencies relative to the dollar. </p>

						policy has become increasingly accommodative in the large OECD economies

						billion of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities per month (0.5% of annual
						GDP). The Bank of Japan is pursuing its new ambitious goal to double the
						monetary base by the end of 2014, primarily through bond purchases of
						increasing maturity. In November, the ECB cut the main refinancing rate to
						0.25% and the marginal lending rate to 0.75%, indicated that the policy
						rates would remain at present or lower levels for an extended period and
						extended the period of full allotment of liquidity. The Bank of England
						issued forward guidance in August, implying that the policy rate would not
						be raised and the stock of purchased assets maintained at least until the
						unemployment rate has fallen to 7%, subject to three

								recovery with still important downside risks, low inflation and well
								anchored inflation expectations. Nevertheless, with reduced slack
								and the steady increase in inflation towards its target, monetary
								stimulus will need to be scaled back gradually to prevent the risk
								of de-anchoring inflation expectations or triggering asset price
								bubbles. Conditional on projected activity developments, it would be
								appropriate to wind down asset purchases in the course of 2014 and
								then to consider gradual increases in the target federal funds rate
								in 2015. Notwithstanding assumed increases in the policy rate, the
								rate at the end of the year would be only 1½ per cent at a time when
								slack in the economy has been significantly reduced and inflation
								has risen near to its target. While this unusually low policy rate
								when inflation is on target and remaining slack is modest is
								consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of attaining both
								price stability and full employment, it risks excessively boosting
								asset prices, unless the latter is effectively mitigated by
								macro-prudential instruments. After 2015, it will be necessary to
								increase the policy rate to avoid unsettling inflation expectations.
								To minimise financial market volatility, the Federal Reserve should
								consider signalling its tightening schedule in advance. However, the
								timing and speed of reductions in monetary stimulus should be
								adjusted if growth looks set to be significantly weaker than
								projected. In this uncertain context, the Federal Reserve should
								also carefully assess the international spillovers from its policy

								may eventually increase further with the expected normalisation of
								monetary policy and dissipation of safe haven effects. Future
								changes may be quite abrupt given the nature of swings in investors’
								sentiment, as experienced for instance in 1994 or more recently.
								Against this backdrop, this box provides an illustrative analysis of

								yields will increase with the amount of bonds held in the trading
								book and their maturity. To illustrate the potential scope for such
								losses, stylised calculations for aggregated banking systems in
								selected OECD countries are made. They use data on the total banking
								sector holdings of domestic general government securities, which
								vary significantly across the analysed countries and are
								particularly high in Japan – almost 1000% of Tier 1 capital (see
								figure below). It is assumed that all these bonds are in the trading
								book – and therefore marked to market – and that the maturity
								structure is the same as that of outstanding central government
								debt, and that bond yields increase by 1 percentage point across the
								yield curve. In practice, not all bonds would be marked to market
								and banks could keep bonds with shorter maturities, but loss
								estimates based on these assumptions give an upper limit and can be
								a useful benchmark. Assuming a smaller share of bonds in the trading
								account and lower average maturity would result in proportionally
								smaller losses. Similarly, losses would be smaller if the yield
								curve steepened with the increase in bond yields at the longer end
								limited to 1 percentage point. Steepening of the yield curve is
								likely when central banks start to reduce the scale of their asset
								purchase programmes.</p>
              <p id="ID5f0bceb0-dafe-4942-a856-9bdf1e8927b4" indent="y" numbering="n">The results suggest that, for most of the countries covered, the
								capital losses due to a 1-percentage point parallel upward shift of
								the yield curve are small (see figure below). Japan appears a
								notable exception, with Japanese banks incurring losses
								corresponding to 70% of Tier 1 capital, but this is likely to be an
								overestimation given the simplifying assumptions. For example, the
								Bank of Japan (2013) estimates – based on disaggregated data – that
								with the same shock, Japanese banks would incur unrealised losses of
								6 trillion yen, i.e. only one-fifth of the above
									estimate.<boxnoteref refid="ID28d52766-7fdb-4130-9785-0b8ac0c05dce" format="boxnoteref"/> This may be partly due to the fact that

						Japan, the underlying primary deficit will fall by about 1½ per cent in 2014
						and 2% of GDP in 2015, but public debt remains on an unsustainable path.
						Hence, the announced increase in the consumption tax rate to 8% in April
						2014 is just the first step toward achieving fiscal sustainability and
						should be followed by the second increase, to 10%, in 2015. A fiscal
						package, expected to amount to around 1% of GDP, will accompany the 2014 tax
						change to offset its immediate negative impact on activity. Around one-third
						of this will comprise tax cuts and the rest additional spending. The
						government plans to finance the package without new bond issuance. To bring
						maximum benefits, the stimulus package should be focused on one-time
						measures with high fiscal multiplier effects, while avoiding permanent
						measures that would limit progress on fiscal consolidation. In addition to
						the fiscal package, Japan will cut taxes by 1 trillion yen. The government
						approved a new medium-term fiscal plan in August, which confirmed that it
						aims to halve the primary budget deficit (relative to GDP) of central and
						local governments from an estimated 6.6% in FY 2010 to 3.3% in FY 2015 and
						achieve balance by FY 2020, and thereafter steadily reduce the public debt
						ratio. With some 3½ percentage points of GDP in consolidation over the next
						two years, the 2015 objective can be met only if fiscal tightening has a
						small adverse effect on activity. This is far from granted given the large
						estimated fiscal multipliers for permanent consolidation measures in Japan
						(Barrell et al., 2012). A more detailed roadmap is essential to underpin the
						credibility of the plan to achieve the 2020 objective and sustain confidence
						in Japan’s public finances. Such a roadmap should include social security
						reforms to limit spending increases, particularly in the areas of health and
						long-term care, as well as revenue increases.</p>

              <p id="ID-42-1115089" indent="y" numbering="n">Although the medium-term
								fiscal headwinds post-2013 appear moderate, mainly a result of the
								very large fiscal consolidation effort already accomplished, the
								difficulties of maintaining high structural primary balances over an
								extended period should not be under-estimated. In Greece, Portugal
								and Italy for instance, partly because of high debt levels, the
								fiscal rules imply maintaining an average underlying primary surplus
								of more than 5% of GDP between 2014 and 2023. Ireland, Spain,
								Belgium, Hungary, Slovenia and France could all need to have an
								average underlying primary surplus of 2% of GDP or more during this
								period. Except for Belgium and Ireland, the other countries have
								never had such high underlying primary surpluses in any 5-year
								period between 1987 and 2009 (see Figure, panel B). The difference
								between the highest underlying primary balance sustained in the
								recent past and that required by the EU fiscal rules is also large
								in the Czech Republic.</p>

						narrow somewhat from 0.9% to about 0.6% of GDP in 2014, though it would be
						higher if it included local governments and, as in the case of public-sector
						liabilities, much higher if it included various off-budget vehicles. Taking
						into account various off-budget forms of debt, the latest <emphasis emph="italic">OECD Economic Survey of China</emphasis> (OECD, 2013c)
						placed total public debt at 57% of GDP at the end of 2010, still relatively
						low, but the concern is less about the level than the recent rate of
						increase. A broad accounting of the public sector’s fiscal position thus
						suggests that much of the scope for countercyclical fiscal policy may have
						been used already. It also raises concerns in view of the potential fiscal
						cost of any eventual credit crisis. The government’s fiscal position, as
						well as its ability to boost social spending and hence consumption, could be
						strengthened by not allowing funds from profitable state-owned enterprises
						to subsidise loss-making companies but instead transferring increased
						dividends to the general budget.</p>

					in the United States, 197 in the OECD euro area countries, 23 in the United
					Kingdom, 11 in Canada and 7 in Japan. Vulnerabilities stemming from the public
					sector are quantified along three dimensions: government net borrowing, gross
					government debt and the difference between 10-year sovereign bond yields in real
					terms and the potential GDP growth rate.</p>

					countries with the next weakest scores in light grey. Higher values generally

						<emphasis emph="bold">diamond charts</emphasis> (an updated version of
					Ahrend and Valdivia, 2012) display financial-accounts-related risk factors to
					financial stability based on previous OECD empirical analysis (Ahrend and
					Goujard, 2012a, 2012b) covering OECD and emerging market economies over the past
					three decades. This shows that a bias in gross external liabilities towards
					debt, in particular bank debt, substantially increases the risk of financial
					crises (bank debt being defined as debt to a foreign bank). In contrast, a
					larger share of FDI in gross external liabilities decreases such risk. Shorter
					banking debt maturities have also been found to increase crisis risk, mainly by
					increasing exposure to financial contagion. The size of reserve holdings appears
					to reduce the probability of crises, whereas neither external assets (excluding
					reserves) nor liabilities as a share of GDP are found to influence crisis risk,
					except when they are exceptionally large.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Economic growth has been modest in 2013 but will gather momentum
						in 2014 and 2015. The on-going fiscal contraction and low consumer and
						business confidence have been creating strong headwinds, but are assumed to
						diminish during 2014. Gradual labour market recovery, debt deleveraging and
						gains in asset prices will underpin consumption and residential investment
						growth. Easing credit conditions and ample corporate cash flow will support
						increasing business investment. </emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The budget situation is becoming healthier, but much of the
						progress is due to across-the-board spending cuts and the expiration of past
						tax cuts. Less attention has been paid to the necessary task of developing a
						medium-term strategy to ensure fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy needs
						to remain accommodative for some time. Nevertheless, if economic growth
						strengthens as expected, monetary policy should begin the gradual process of
						normalisation, first by tapering large-scale bond purchases and then, in the
						course of 2015, by starting to raise policy interest rates towards a more
						neutral stance.</emphasis>

						fiscal drag held back aggregate demand and rises in long-term interest rates
						slowed the housing market. The political impasse over the budget leading to
						the government shutdown and the uncertainties linked to the debt ceiling are
						estimated to have subtracted about 0.5% from growth (at an annual rate) in
						the last quarter of 2013.</p>

						employment gains have contributed to a falling unemployment rate and point
						to the underlying strength of the economy during a period of strong
						headwinds. However, labour force participation has also fallen substantially
						since 2008.While this partly reflects demographic changes, some of it is
						cyclical, and, as in past cyclical rebounds, workers who are currently only
						marginally attached to the labour market, or who are working part time for
						economic reasons, are likely to seek jobs more actively once the job market

						choking off the recovery, against the risks of a build-up of inflationary

						strong export growth, consumer spending amid rising confidence and

						continue to play fully if the economy under or over-performs current
						expectations. The government is to put greater emphasis on reducing public
						expenditure. This is a welcome move given the scale of public spending and
						the scope for tackling inefficient or unnecessary spending. Reduced public

						Iceland’s economy has improved, it remains subject to substantial downside

						increases in interest rates, which could be triggered by rising wage
						pressures in a tight labour market. Finally, further delays could occur in
						the roll-out of energy-intensive investment projects, owing to difficulties
						with government approvals and overcapacity in the global aluminum industry.
						On the other hand, Iceland could benefit from a firmer global outlook,
						better-than-assumed terms of trade and a more rapid implementation of

						at nearly 7% of GDP – with exceptional gold purchases having increased
						imports by about 1½ percentage points of GDP. These imbalances reflect the

						August, in order to raise the demand for services. By design, the tax yield
						will fall, pushing up the deficit a bit. Central government debt stands at
						16% of GDP. This is more than offset by the financial assets in social
						security funds and other parts of the government. Even so, local public debt
						may be of the order of 35% of GDP according to some estimates, though its
						exact size is uncertain as the most recent audit was in 2010 and was not
						sufficiently wide-ranging. In addition, there are other loans guaranteed by
						the government which are contingent rather than actual liabilities, but
						which could weigh on public finances in the future. A more complete audit is

						oil-price-based fiscal rule and the medium term fiscal framework drive
						fiscal policy appropriately towards gradual narrowing of the non-oil
						deficit. However, the automatic stabilisers should allow the deficit to
						raise temporarily if growth disappoints. Although the pressures for fiscal
						stimulus have led to the decision to make the National Welfare Fund
						available for investment lending, the fiscal constraints are reflected in
						the draft budget submitted to the State Duma. The budget outlines savings,
						including a wage freeze for state employees, in an attempt to free fiscal
						room for previously announced spending priorities: modernising the army,
						strengthening social protection and investing in infrastructure. Planned
						changes in the pension system mark a welcome step towards fiscal
						sustainability. </p>
