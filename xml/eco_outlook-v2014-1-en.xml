ACHIEVING A RESILIENT RECOVERY</mainhead>
      </heading>
      <p id="ID-42-1096315" indent="n" numbering="n">The recovery from the Great Recession has been slow and arduous, and has at times threatened to derail altogether. The major advanced economies are finally gaining momentum.  Private-sector confidence is rebuilding. After years of weakness, investment and trade have started to rebound.  While unemployment remains unacceptably high, the labour market situation is improving in most countries and has stopped deteriorating virtually throughout the advanced economies.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096397" indent="y" numbering="n">On the other hand, the pace of growth in the major emerging market economies has slowed.  Part of this deceleration is benign, reflecting cyclical slowdowns from overheated starting positions - the growth rates now seen in China are undoubtedly more sustainable from both economic and environmental perspectives than the double-digit pace of a few years ago. However, managing the credit slowdown and the risks that built up during the period of easy global monetary conditions could be a major challenge.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096330" indent="y" numbering="n">The likelihood of some of the most worrisome events that have preoccupied markets and policymakers in recent years has diminished.  Risks are overall better balanced although still tilted to the downside.  Financial tensions in emerging markets are one risk that could blow the global recovery off course and have bigger spillovers than anticipated.  It is not the only one.  Falling inflation in the euro area  could turn into deflation.  Geopolitical risks have also increased since the start of the year.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096414" indent="y" numbering="n">Policy focus can now switch from avoiding disaster to fostering a stronger and more resilient recovery.  The legacy of the crisis still needs to be addressed.  The crisis has left scars in the labour market, notably higher unemployment and lower participation of the more vulnerable groups.  Growth prospects are weaker than in the pre-crisis era. Moreover, one of the key lessons of the crisis is the need to make our economies and societies more resilient - more robust to shocks - and more inclusive, with the welfare gains from stronger growth better shared across the population. While steps have been taken in both areas, much more needs to be done.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096498" indent="y" numbering="n">After difficult years of low growth and fiscal stringency, policymakers are facing these challenges with depleted political capital.  But they need to seize the opportunity to set global growth on a stronger and more sustainable footing.  This is key to supporting confidence and has to be backed by macroeconomic and structural policy actions, including the promotion of institutional frameworks that support the implementation of reforms.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096530" indent="y" numbering="n">Given persisting downside risks, high unemployment, below-target inflation, and high levels of government debt, monetary policies need to remain accommodative in the main OECD areas.  In particular, we call on the European Central Bank (ECB) to take new policy actions to move inflation more decisively towards target and to be ready for additional non-conventional stimulus if inflation were to show no clear sign of returning there.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096535" indent="y" numbering="n">The high levels of government debt in all major advanced economies mean that there is little room for fiscal accommodation.  Nevertheless, following significant progress in stabilising their public finances, most OECD countries can afford the planned slowdown in structural budget improvement.  This is not the case of Japan where consolidation needs remain very large. Given its high level of public debt, a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan is essential.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096540" indent="y" numbering="n">In most countries, reducing public debt to more prudent levels and managing future pension and health spending pressures will be a challenge and requires fiscal reforms to ensure the sustainability of public finances without compromising the quality of public services.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096503" indent="y" numbering="n">It is now time to speed up the pace of structural reforms. Such reforms, while often facing resistance from vested interests, can offer a win-win by raising growth potential and allowing many of the poorest to achieve higher living standards. These policies are critical to the success of Abenomics in Japan, as well as to rebalance of the euro area and foster the convergence to higher incomes by emerging economies.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1096508" indent="y" numbering="n">While impressive reform efforts have been made by crisis countries, there remains substantial scope to boost productivity and create jobs through policies to remove barriers to domestic and international competition in both advanced and emerging economies.  This would increase innovation and help get the most out of global value chains, as well as boost investment in the near term and support resilience.</p>
      <p id="ID-42-1099168" indent="y" numbering="n">As unemployment starts receding, measures to tackle long-term unemployment and make sure it does not become entrenched are a high priority that requires reforms to remove obstacles to more robust job creation and strengthen and redesign active labour market policies.</p>

A more modest upturn is likely in the euro area, with unemployment remaining high and disinflationary pressures ebbing only slowly.

          <p id="ID887ff9a7-f595-4c7e-ad69-2823fa951720" indent="y" numbering="n">The global recovery is expected to strengthen at a moderate pace, despite some near-term weaknesses and still significant risks and vulnerabilities. Global growth this year is projected to be marginally softer than expected in the November <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>, at just under 3Â½ per cent, reflecting moderating activity in the large emerging market economies (EMEs), especially China, before picking up to almost 4% in 2015 (<xref refid="ID-42-1014477" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). Still-accommodative monetary policies, the continued feed-through of past improvements in financial conditions and reduced fiscal consolidation will support activity in the OECD economies, with growth in the United States stronger than in Japan and the euro area. Given the moderate pace of the recovery, the OECD-wide unemployment rate may decline by only Â½ percentage point over 2014-15 to 7.1% by end-2015, still leaving 11Â¼ million more people unemployed than in early 2008. This will keep inflation low, especially in the euro area. In the major EMEs, who are displaying less of their former dynamism, growth is projected to remain close to current rates, as the impact of tighter financial conditions and past policy tightening takes effect. The balance of risks remains somewhat to the downside, despite the improving economic outlook, taking into account concerns about uncertain prospects in China, theÂ impact that steps toward monetary policy normalisation in the UnitedÂ States may have on some EMEs, fiscal challenges in Japan, and, in the euroÂ area, remaining financial fragilities and possible additional disinflationary pressures. Geopolitical uncertainty has also risen, in part due to the events in Ukraine. On the upside, some of these concerns could ease more quickly than expected, and investment turn out stronger than projected
if, for example, the Asset Quality Review were to strengthen confidence in euro area banks, and if pent-up demand were to boost US activity more quickly than expected.</p>

          <p id="IDc1522644-41a0-4c60-a85a-44fd6af52544" indent="y" numbering="n">With a moderate recovery, high unemployment, still large estimated slack, subdued inflation and downside risks, accommodative macroeconomic policies are still needed in the main OECD areas. In the United States, where the underlying recovery is more firmly based, a gradual reduction of monetary policy stimulus should proceed during the coming two years, although policy rates should remain well below historical norms. In contrast, monetary accommodation needs to be increased as planned in Japan, and monetary policy should be eased further in the euro area, with additional non-conventional stimulus being warranted if inflation were to show no sign of returning toward the 2% target. Micro and macro-prudential instruments should be developed as soon as possible and used fully, if needed, to prevent possible credit excesses and related asset price bubbles in particular markets. In view of high and still-rising government debt, there is little room for fiscal accommodation. Nevertheless, given significant past consolidation, the United States and some euro area countries can afford the planned slowdown in structural budget improvements, in contrast to Japan where consolidation should proceed steadily given daunting fiscal challenges. The OECD economies also need to continue with structural reforms to enhance resilience and inclusiveness, accelerate the recovery and improve economic outcomes in the medium term in order to reduce unemployment durably and ease both external imbalances and long-term fiscal burdens.</p>

China faces a difficult policy dilemma since sustaining a robust growth momentum may require policy measures that could heighten financial stability and public finance risks. Prudential measures should be used to slow gradually rapid credit expansion and harder budget constraints should be imposed on local governments, thereby helping to rebalance the economy towards domestic consumption and minimise risks of disruptive financial turbulence. If growth were to slow sharply, monetary policy will have to be eased. In other EMEs, the appropriate monetary policy stance will depend on inflation and exchange rate developments. In these economies, growth-enhancing structural reforms should be re-started to help improve macroeconomic fundamentals and boost investorsâ confidence.</p>

More recently, uncertainty about the near-term pace of the recovery has risen, with one-off factors, such as unusual weather conditions, temporary tax-induced spending and a moderation in inventory accumulation, making it difficult to interpret developments in some economies in the first quarter of 2014, including the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan. There has also been confirmation of a further growth slowdown in China and some of the other large EMEs recently affected by financial turmoil. Survey indicators have diverged across countries as well, with forward-looking indicators such as all-industry new orders holding up well in the large OECD economies, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, but being at much softer levels in the major non-OECD economies (<xref refid="ID83c89ab6-e549-40f1-8c1f-a72fc962999a" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). </p>

Indicators of current conditions and near-term prospects for the BRIICS are also somewhat weaker than expected earlier, though they have edged up in India and Brazil, albeit from relatively low levels. This partly reflects a tightening of financial conditions (see below). In China, growth appears to be moderating. PMI survey indicators and retail sales growth have softened (<xref refid="ID83c89ab6-e549-40f1-8c1f-a72fc962999a" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>) and there are signs that the necessary adjustment of the property market may have started, with the strength of house price and sales growth having eased in early 2014. The recent growth developments in the EMEs should be seen against the background of already downward revised growth projections for BRIICS over the past year and a reduction in their estimated potential growth rates. </p>

Growing uncertainties about economic prospects and the ensuing policy response, and risks related to continued strong credit growth in early 2014 despite restraining policy measures, have pushed down equity prices and led to some increase in long-term government bond yields. The nominal effective exchange rate has remained stronger than last year, in spite of its recent depreciation following attempts by the authorities to curb carry-trades driven by expectations of sustained renminbi appreciation and the widening of the daily renminbi-dollar exchange rate band. In contrast, interbank market rates have declined from their recent highs to below levels in the second half of 2013. </p>

Against the backdrop of the tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve, the combination of an increase in geopolitical and economic uncertainty, in particular in Turkey, Argentina and more recently related to the events in Ukraine, and weaker-than-expected data releases in early 2014 led to a renewed deterioration in investorsâ sentiment in a number of EMEs. This triggered capital outflows and also declines in exchange rates and bond and equity prices. In response, several central banks raised policy rates, notably in Turkey, and some intervened in currency markets. </p>

For instance, exchange rates hardly depreciated during the turbulent period in Brazil, India and Indonesia, which seems to be related to recently improving external imbalances (India and Indonesia), higher policy rates (Brazil, India and Indonesia) and an improved monetary policy framework (India). In several EMEs, exchange rates have subsequently appreciated, more than offsetting the losses of early 2014, and long-term government bond yields have stabilised or even declined. Nevertheless, overall financial conditions in the EMEs outside China have tightened significantly since mid-2013, with higher policy rates and bond yields offset only partially by nominal effective exchange rates remaining between 10% and 20% lower than a year ago. Even if depreciation has improved the trade outlook, this has increased the burden of debt denominated in foreign currencies and raised inflationary pressures.</p>

          <p id="ID15aebe57-9c79-4a83-b042-db3f32450672" indent="y" numbering="n">Given the weaker and more differentiated reaction of financial markets in EMEs in early 2014 to the tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve than in mid-2013 (when the tapering discussion started), risks of a financial meltdown in EMEs have eased. With most EMEs now having flexible exchange rates, higher foreign exchange reserves and higher capital buffers in their financial institutions than before earlier event shocks, such as those in Asia and Russia in 1997-98, they also look less vulnerable to financial crisis than in the past. Nevertheless, serious turmoil in some EMEs cannot be excluded whilst monetary policy in the United States normalises and long-term interest rates rise (Rawdanowicz et al., 2014). Several of them are still highly dependent on portfolio inflows and short-term loans from foreign banks, have a high share of debt in total foreign liabilities, and domestic companies have large foreign currency debts. In China, it is unclear whether the authorities will succeed in slowing rapid credit expansion, in the context of growing risks to financial stability (<xref refid="ID-42-1014886" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>), and rebalancing growth from investment to consumption without disruption. With the EMEs accounting for a larger share of global GDP than in the past, a significant slowdown in these economies could have strong effects on global growth. Although model simulations suggest that without a major financial crisis even a significant slowdown in the EMEs would not have large effects on the main OECD areas,<fnote id="ID-42-1014751"><p id="ID588bd3d2-ab6b-4e58-b380-5c6e1d16a28c" indent="y" numbering="n">Simulations on the NiGEM global macro-model suggest that a one-year, 2-percentage point decline in domestic demand growth in the main EMEs, including China, could lower OECD GDP growth by around

              <p id="ID-42-1015069" indent="y" numbering="n">The regular commercial banking sector in China has become large, with total assets exceeding 200% of GDP by end-2012 (see table below), i.e. below the average for the OECD countries but significantly above other BRIICS. This has been associated with a rapid expansion of domestic claims of depositary institutions (comprising commercial banks, the central bank, and other banking institutions), increasing by 30% of GDP between 2008 and 2012, when they reached 155% of GDP. Such a fast pace, which often has presaged financial crises for advanced countries in the past (Zhang and Chen, 2013), raises concerns about credit quality and financial stability, especially as economic growth looks set to be weaker in the coming years than in the past five years. The formal commercial banking sector seems, however, well capitalised (see table below) and is in a transition to being subject to more stringent regulation than envisaged in Basel III. Non-performing loans are small and banks have made sizeable loss provisions. This suggests that banks have large buffers to absorb losses in case of a negative shock. Nevertheless, some of the banking indicators may not adequately account for off-balance sheet exposures and several risks are present.</p>

Estimates of the size of the shadow banking sector range widely, between 44% and 69% of GDP as of end-2012.<boxnoteref refid="CHDFHDIA" format="boxnoteref"/> Shadow banking has boomed in response to tighter regulation of regular banking activity to damp credit growth since 2010 and to caps on deposit interest rates, in an environment of unmet demand for credit and search for higher yield by wealthy individuals and cash-rich enterprises. The most popular shadow banking products include wealth management products (WMPs) and trust products (TPs), which together are estimated to account for over 35% of GDP in 2013 (see figure below). The former are short-term (up to one-year) investment products. Regulated banks sell WMPs and manage pooled money off-balance sheet by investing mainly in longer-term fixed-income bonds. The WMPs allow banks which offer these products to shift some of the assets off balance sheet to reduce obligatory deposit reserves and to report a favourable deposit base by setting the expiration date of WMPs for the end of reference period (IMF, 2012b), which is longer than the maintenance period of reserve requirements. The TPs are longer-term investment products, and trust companies lend funds entrusted by their clients to real-estate and industrial projects as well as investing them in financial products.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1018772" indent="y" numbering="n">Shadow and regular banks are exposed to Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs), by making loans to them and investing in their bonds, which risks undermining the asset quality of the banks. The LGFVs were established by local governments to finance infrastructure and public real estate projects. Their debt increased rapidly over recent years to an estimated CNY 19 trillion, or 37% of GDP, at end-2012, with some analysis suggesting that nearly half of this debt would be non-performing without fiscal subsidies and special accounting practices enabling LGFVs to understate financial costs by capitalising interest expenses (Zhang et al., 2013).</p>

              <p id="ID-42-1023111" indent="y" numbering="n">The banking sector is sensitive to declines in real estate prices given that nearly 30% of total bank loans, including loans to LGFVs, are allocated to the real estate sector.<boxnoteref refid="CHDIGFCH" format="boxnoteref"/> Falling prices will reduce the actual and expected profitability of real-estate projects, on which their repayment capacity depends, thereby jeopardising creditors. The negative consequences of this could be amplified by negative feedback effects between the real economy, real estate prices and the financial sector. Such feedbacks would largely depend on the feasibility for, and the willingness of, local governments to give fiscal supports to failing LGFVs, with implications for their creditors. Local governments, however, have almost no freedom to change the tax rate and tax base (OECD, 2013a) and their revenues largely depend on land sales (IMF, 2013). Thus, lower revenues could entail reduced financial support to LGFVs and in turn curtail public investment and weaken bank balance sheets. If so, local governments might be encouraged to accelerate the sale of land, amplifying the initial price declines (OECD, 2013c).</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1023116" indent="y" numbering="n">There is also the risk of a run on shadow banking products, as most of them do not come with an explicit guarantee of the principal. If individual shadow banking products were to default, leading to losses of principal, a general run on shadow banking products could not be excluded. This risk, however, will be mitigated if banks offering such products and trust companies bail out failed shadow banking products for fear of reputational damage, although such bailouts would be associated with higher demand by rescuing financial institutions for liquidity. Such a risk could materialise this year as a large part of TPs is set to mature in 2014. The strong interconnectedness between regular banks and shadow banking products highlights the systemic importance of these products. </p>
              <p id="ID-42-1023121" indent="y" numbering="n">The risk of a systemic crisis in China's financial system will depend on the authorities' response. They have already implemented some micro-prudential regulations to limit LGFVs financing and increase the level of oversight of the WMPs, but it remains to be seen if they will be effective.<boxnoteref refid="CHDIIGCD" format="boxnoteref"/> The central government seems to have enough fiscal space to bail out failed LGFVs and financial institutions to minimise the risk of contagion. The central government is a major landowner and shareholder (Ueda and Gomi, 2013) and its official debt was CNY 9.4 trillion (18% of GDP) at end-2012 (National Audit Office, 2013). However, the fiscal cost could be very high, reflecting sizeable governmental contingent liabilities and the under-estimation of the size of LGFVs' liabilities.<boxnoteref refid="CHDCFIAA" format="boxnoteref"/> Such intervention could also aggravate moral hazard problems. The recent rescue of a TP institution (Credit Equals Gold No.1) may underpin individual investors' beliefs in future bailouts by related financial institutions and governments.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1023126" indent="y" numbering="n">The risk of international financial and trade spillovers could be larger than expected from direct linkages alone. The Chinese banking sector is not deeply integrated with global financial markets, implying limited financial spillovers. Foreign banks accounted for less than 2% of total banking sector assets as of end-2012, and financial claims on Chinese banks of the OECD countries are very small (below 1% of GDP, with the exception of the United Kingdom). Financial turbulence in China could, however, weaken further international investors' asset values and sentiment, with negative implications for financial stability in other EMEs. This spillover could, in particular, go through Hong Kong where large Chinese companies and banks have a significant presence in equity markets.<boxnoteref refid="CHDBDAAB" format="boxnoteref"/> With credit-dependent economic growth, the policy-induced slowdown in credit or financial turmoil in the banking sector could damp domestic growth and spill over to other countries via trade. Simulations of the NiGEM model suggest that a 2-percentage point decline in domestic demand growth during one year could reduce OECD growth by 0.1%, with a somewhat stronger impact in Japan and some other BRIICS. This relatively small impact is found in other studies (e.g. by IMF, 2012a) and seems to reflect the fact that China is not yet a dominant export destination for OECD countries and a part of its imports is re-exported and thus dependent on demand outside China (Ollivaud</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1032258" indent="n" numbering="n"><emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2014). However, such simulations fail to account for confidence effects and disruptions of global value chains with knock-on effects on production and profits in other countries. Slower Chinese growth could also lower commodity prices as China is the largest consumer of many commodities.<boxnoteref refid="CHDGBGDF" format="boxnoteref"/></p>

If contingent liabilities for which the government co-signs, as well as those for which the government does not assume the legal responsibility of repayment but commits to supporting failed debtors, are taken into account, the central government's debt-to-GDP ratio would have been 23% at end-2012. Likewise, general government's debt-to-GDP ratio would have been 54% at that time. Debt would be even larger if LGFVs' debt is fully accounted for. Zhang et al. (2013) suggest that the recent survey by the National Audit Office (2013) on local government and LGFVs debt could involve an underestimation of local government debt in 2012 by around 12.8 trillion due to under-reporting of LGFVs liabilities. Adjusting for this, local and general government debts as of end-2012 would be CNY 28.7 trillion and CNY 40.6 trillion (78% of GDP), respectively.</p>

              <p id="ID-42-1015796" indent="y" numbering="n">Headline consumer price inflation in the OECD economies has fallen by 1Â¾ percentage points since September 2011 and in many economies has been well below central banks' targets in recent months. Inflation has also eased in the large non-OECD emerging market economies but does not appear to be particularly low: inflation in the BRIICS is currently 5% (year-on-year) and almost 7Â¼Â per cent excluding China. This box sets out the key factors that can account for the disinflation in the OECD economies.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1015806" indent="y" numbering="n">A large part of the disinflation in OECD over the past 2Â½ years appears to be due to sizeable falls in energy price inflation. Declines in food price inflation and in core inflation have also contributed to the overall drop in headline inflation. </p>

                  <p id="ID-42-1015860" indent="y" numbering="n">The sharp decline in energy price inflation, from double-digit figures during 2011 to more subdued rates in 2012 and 2013, accounts for around 1Â¼ percentage points of the fall in OECD headline inflation since the peak in September 2011. This reduction in the growth of household energy prices reflects weaker commodity price growth (reflecting both supply improvements and a softening of demand, especially from China) and the fading effects of earlier increases in administered prices in many countries. This has been a relatively important factor behind disinflation in the euro area and the United Kingdom, and a more modest influence in the United States. Japan is an exception amongst the major economies, with energy prices having risen quite strongly, reflecting the increased demand for imported energy since the earthquake in 2011 and also the large depreciation of the yen. </p>

                  <p id="ID-42-1036322" indent="y" numbering="n">A decline in food price inflation accounts for a further Â¼ percentage points of the fall in OECD-wide inflation, with the annual rate of OECD-wide food price inflation slowing from over 4% to 1.7%, which is low by historical standards. Food price disinflation may not persist, with food commodity prices turning up in 2014.</p>

                  <p id="ID-42-1036334" indent="y" numbering="n">Disinflation in non-food, non-energy goods and services prices accounts for the remaining Â¼ percentage point decline in OECD-wide inflation. This decline in core inflation is likely due to sizeable domestic economic slack. Indeed, there is a clear positive relationship between the changes in core inflation and output gaps over the past two years, particularly outside of the euro area (see first figure below). Subdued non-commodity import price growth has also helped to contain cost pressures and contributed to the current softness in non-energy industrial goods price inflation. However, Japan is again an important exception amongst the large economies, with prices being pushed up, helped by the depreciation of the yen and improvements in economic conditions.</p>

                  <p id="ID-42-1036346" indent="y" numbering="n">In some countries recent inflation softening also reflects one-off factors. Notable examples include the falls in the price of health care services in the United States (in April 2013 and January 2014), and the passing of the earlier boost from increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in many European countries (discussed further below).</p>

Falling energy prices can account for three-fifths of the 2Â½ percentage point decline in the headline inflation rate since September 2011 but there has also been a reduction of 1 percentage point in the year-on-year rate of core inflation (abstracting from energy, food, alcohol and tobacco). </p>

For this group overall, the annual rate of core inflation is around Â¼ percentage point and is negative in some countries. In the core euro area economies, non-energy, non-food inflation has also eased, but remains well above zero and is still close to the average rate since 1999.</p>

Indeed, inflation in services prices has fallen to unusually low levels in the vulnerable countries (with price declines in some), driving the euro area aggregate to very low levels by historical standards (see figure above). However, this will also reflect the upward boost from indirect tax increases having now passed. By contrast, services inflation in the core countries has been relatively constant (ECB, 2014a), though, if sustained, the recent slowing in unit labour cost growth in the core economies could start to push down inflation.</p>

          <p id="IDa9b8bb20-d422-4018-a29a-35c3b77aee3f" indent="y" numbering="n">Disinflationary pressures are now strongest in the euro area, where headline inflation is well below the ECB objective of a rate close to 2% and the annual rate of core inflation declined by around Â¾ percentage point over the year to March, to just 0.7 per cent, before rising back to an estimated 1% in April. Disinflationary pressures were expected in many vulnerable economies, reflecting a necessary relative price adjustment to regain competitiveness, with weak demand and structural reforms strengthening competition and compressing price and wage increases. However, inflation has also weakened noticeably in several core countries, including France and Germany, where the annual headline rate is now at 0.7% and 1.1% respectively and unit labour cost growth is less than 1%. In part, this reflects a common decline in import price pressures brought about by an appreciation of the euro effective exchange rate. Even so, it has heightened the risk that any renewed weakness in demand, further appreciation of the euro, declines in commodity prices, or an unanchoring of inflation expectations, could result in a period of very low area-wide inflation, or even deflation, thereby constraining activity by further raising real interest rates and intensifying debt service burdens in many economies. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, but, as shown by the experience of Japan in the 1990s, deflation can still set in whilst inflation expectations remain positive.</p>

Measures of uncertainty rose sharply both in 2008-09 and then following the intensification of the euro area crisis in mid-2011, and the share of financial assets held as currency and deposits by non-financial enterprises is presently well above longer-term norms. Amongst the major OECD economies, the (nominal) share of business investment in GDP is presently around 1 percentage point below pre-crisis norms, and well below steady-state levels implicit in OECD long-term projections (<xref refid="ID-42-1014961" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>; <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDb048f9d2-7700-4b1d-97d2-29e5c3a7b2b3"/>).

              <p id="ID-42-1016547" indent="y" numbering="n">A significant part of the shortfall in business investment can be linked to weak demand, as discussed in the main text,<boxnoteref refid="CHDJEDEB" format="boxnoteref"/> but other factors are likely to have also played a dampening role, including: increases in the user cost of capital; a prolonged period of heightened economic and policy uncertainty; and higher levels of corporate leverage preceding the crisis. With the recovery in activity underway and many of these other drags having receded, business investment might be expected to increase once more. </p>
              <p id="ID-42-1016567" indent="y" numbering="n">Another indication of the difference between current investment levels and longer-term needs can be obtained by estimating an illustrative steady state investment-to-output ratio using inputs from the OECD long-term growth projections (see <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDb048f9d2-7700-4b1d-97d2-29e5c3a7b2b3"/>). From around 2020 onwards in the long-term database, the constant-price capital-output ratio moves around a long-run level according to changes in the real cost of capital, with output gaps generally closed from this point. Assuming that an equilibrium ratio is attained at a particular point in time, the capital-output ratio, the depreciation rate and the growth rate of potential output in the long-term baseline can be used to calculate an implicit steady state investment-to-output ratio that is required to maintain this.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1016577" indent="y" numbering="n">This steady-state level of investment to (potential) output is given by: <graphic graphic="eps/ch1/tab/eqn001.pdf" type="graphic"/>, where k* is the steady-state capital-output ratio, Î´ is the depreciation rate which is assumed to be constant over time, and g is the endogenous potential growth rate, which is dependent upon labour utilisation, physical and human capital intensity and multi-factor productivity. In the calculations below, k* is set at the ratio of (non-residential) capital to trend output in 2025 in the long-term baseline scenario, by which time current trends in capital intensity have generally stabilised but is not so distant that new forces pushing up the cost of capital have taken hold. Steady-state values for g and Î´ are approximated by the average over 2020-2025. </p>
              <p id="ID-42-1044037" indent="y" numbering="n">The resulting values for the implicit steady-state level of investment are shown in the figure below compared to the current ratio of investment to potential GDP. In most OECD economies, investment ratios in 2013 are below the illustrative steady-state level, with a gap of 2 percentage points or more in one-third. But there is a fairly large range, with the current investment ratio above this implicit longer-term level in some countries. The strong investment growth projected in 2014 and 2015 helps to close this gap in many economies, including Germany and the United States, but still leaves a considerable shortfall to make up in several economies.<boxnoteref refid="CHDDGGEF" format="boxnoteref"/></p>
              <p id="ID-42-1044047" indent="y" numbering="n">The calculations are only illustrative, since the growth rate of potential output and the user cost of capital, and hence the implied steady state capital-output and investment-output ratios, fluctuate over the full OECD long-term projections and are thus sensitive to the assumptions made about the steady-state capital ratio, depreciation rate and potential growth rate of output. Consequently the catch-up in investment needed to reach a given steady-state capital output ratio is also affected. For instance, a continuation of the past steady upward trend in the depreciation rate, reflecting the change in the mix of capital goods, would raise the steady-state level of investment required to maintain any given capital stock. Alternatively, trend output growth could be stronger than in the baseline if additional growth-enhancing structural reforms are undertaken. </p>

The higher depreciation rate and stronger potential output growth each account for around one-half of these additional effects.<boxnoteref refid="CHDDBDCF" format="boxnoteref"/> Lower rates of depreciation or potential output growth would be associated with correspondingly lower investment ratios. </p>

Corporate balance sheets are generally healthy, outside of the vulnerable economies in the euro area; greater risk appetite, as reflected in stronger equity prices and strong demand in corporate bond markets, has raised the availability of external finance; and solid profit growth, outside the euro area, has further improved the availability of internal funding. By some measures, policy uncertainty has also declined, especially in the United States (<xref refid="ID501bf6c4-4cba-4bda-b5ae-a84ead304982" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>) and also in the euro area with continued progress towards a full banking union. In the latter half of 2013, business investment growth picked up in a large number of economies, particularly sharply in the United Kingdom, and capital goods orders in some of the major OECD economies point to a further pick-up in the first half of this year.</p>

Prospects are weaker in parts of the euro area, reflecting subdued final demand, less favourable balance sheet developments, impaired credit channels and still high barriers to product market competition in some economies. The risks around this central scenario are broadly balanced. Investment growth may be weaker if interest rates were to increase sharply or if final demand growth were to slow once more. However, it could also surprise on the upside if accelerator effects are stronger than expected or if confidence were to improve more quickly as uncertainty is removed, for instance because of a successful outcome from the Asset Quality Review of euro area banks.</p>

In the decade prior to 2008, trade intensity rose steadily, with trade growth being around 1Â¾ times the pace of global GDP growth. This reflected the rapid globalisation of economic activities during this period, with new global supply chains being constructed, the rapid development of many EMEs, especially China, and the boost to cross-border services trade provided by new ICT developments and financial globalisation. The factors behind the weaker recent level of trade intensity remain unclear, but may include the one-time nature of earlier boosts to trade intensity, an increased number of trade restrictions since the crisis began (OECD/WTO/UNCTAD, 2013) and changes in the composition of final expenditure in the major economies.<fnote id="ID-42-1014894"><p id="ID85680165-d526-49a8-9295-89d94b24356f" indent="y" numbering="n">The trade-restrictive measures introduced by G-20 members since October 2008 presently cover around 5% of G-20 merchandise imports. Only one-fifth of the measures introduced since the start of the crisis have subsequently been eliminated (OECD/WTO/UNCTAD, 2013).</p></fnote> In particular, as discussed above, fixed investment (a trade-intensive expenditure category) has been much weaker than in the pre-crisis period, and import growth has slowed particularly sharply in those economies in which investment has been the weakest relative to pre-crisis norms.<fnote id="ID-42-1014951"><p id="IDff2cef79-535a-424e-96a8-d48db1983358" indent="y" numbering="n">Evidence from input-output tables and empirical studies suggests that investment and exports are the most import-intensive components of domestic demand (Pain et al., 2005; BussiÃ¨re et al., 2013).</p></fnote></p>

This was helped by stronger demand in the major OECD economies, particularly for fixed investment and inventories, and a resurgence of trade involving EMEs, especially in Asia. Global export orders have also strengthened over the past six months in all G7 countries. For trade intensity to pick up further, much depends on whether capital investment can strengthen gradually, as projected. If so, trade growth could pick up to just over 5Â¾ per cent at an annualised rate by the latter half of 2014 and around 6Â½ per cent by the latter half of 2015, around 1Â½ times the level of global GDP growth. In the medium-term the direct effects of the trade facilitation measures in the recently concluded Bali agreement should boost global activity and trade, and could even have a positive near-term effect on business confidence and investment.<fnote id="ID-42-1015005"><p id="ID2215d957-dd50-4d18-af2b-61c7eb82e922" indent="y" numbering="n">The long-run benefits from the trade facilitation agreement are estimated to be just under $1 trillion (equivalent to 1.3% of world GDP in 2013) by Hufbauer and Schott (2013).</p></fnote> A successful conclusion to the current negotiations on the transatlantic and transpacific trade agreements could further boost such effects.</p>

Interbank interest rates have edged up from historical lows and have been more volatile amid shrinking liquidity, with LTROs loans continuing to be repaid. In the first quarter of 2014, bank credit standards were eased marginally although credit demand remained weak, but less so than in previous quarters. Credit continued to decline but non-financial corporations increased bond issuance and non-bank borrowing.</p>

In particular, bank lending rates in the vulnerable countries have increased almost continuously in comparison with Germany and credit conditions have been tightened by more in the vulnerable countries than in the core countries (see first figure below). This, together with adverse demand effects, resulted in larger declines in credit in the vulnerable countries.<boxnoteref refid="CHDIBCGJ" format="boxnoteref"/> While over the past two years financial fragmentation, as measured by spreads in government bond yields, has receded, credit conditions for non-financial corporations have not yet materially converged. </p>

Indeed, empirical evidence suggests that diverging perceptions of credit risk across euro area countries can explain the differing cost of borrowing (ECB, 2013a). This is consistent with the observation that bank lending rates are generally higher in countries with higher ratios of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans (see figure below; Illes and Lombardi, 2013).</p>

This partly relates to greater sovereign risks, especially with the intensification of sovereign debt tensions in 2010 and the ensuing massive increase in government bond yields, given interconnectedness between banks and sovereigns and some arbitrage between returns on deposits and government bonds. The role of funding costs is supported by estimates from empirical models of bank lending rates (Al-Eyd and Berkmen, 2013).</p>

Bank lending rates tend to be negatively related to leverage ratios according to empirical studies (Al-Eyd and Berkmen, 2013).

Risk perceptions are now the main factor contributing to tighter credit conditions for non financial companies in the periphery (ECB, 2013a; ECB, 2014b).</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1053618" indent="y" numbering="n">Looking ahead, credit conditions for non-financial corporations are likely to converge gradually across the euro area but to remain more differentiated than prior to the crisis. In particular, the recent large fall in government bond yields and CDS spreads should gradually feed through to bank funding costs and in turn bank lending rates in the vulnerable countries (figure below). Similarly, with the projected return to growth in the periphery, even if modest, credit risks and thus bank lending rates should ultimately decline. Cleaning up bank balance sheets and recapitalisation in the context of the forthcoming asset quality review and bank stress tests could also reduce funding costs. Nevertheless, financial fragmentation is not likely to be eliminated fully as differences in economic growth and credit risk perceptions across the euro area countries are likely to persist.</p>

In Europe, strong house price growth is continuing in Germany (based on data from the big cities) and Switzerland, and has also resumed in the United Kingdom, even though UK prices are already above longer-term norms relative to rents and incomes. Markets remain softer in other parts of the euro area, reflecting weak income growth and tighter financing conditions. Recent data however suggest that the long declines in real house prices in Ireland and the Netherlands may now have started to bottom out. In the United States, housing developments are mixed. Prices continue to rise, but new home sales, starts and buildersâ confidence have turned down, in part due to adverse weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014, but also because of a moderation in mortgage purchase applications since long-term mortgage rates rose last summer. Existing home sales have also declined, although much of this appears to reflect a welcome drop in the level of distressed sales. Looking ahead, given the likelihood of continued solid income growth, further easing of credit standards and pent-up demand after a period of subdued household formation rates, the housing market recovery should continue through this year and next. In Japan, real house prices are continuing to edge down, but land prices have now begun to stabilise and housing investment has been very buoyant, although this has now faded given the temporary boost provided by the demand for sales contracts to be finalised ahead of the consumption tax increase inÂ April.</p>

However, the recovery should gain pace steadily, with private demand benefitting from favourable financial conditions, strengthened household and corporate balance sheets, accommodative monetary policy and the easing drag from fiscal consolidation. Reduced uncertainty and normal cyclical forces should also boost business investment. Export prospects should improve, but this will be more than offset by growing imports. Solid employment growth is projected to continue, with the unemployment rate declining to just below 6% by end-2015 and the negative output gap fading steadily. An upside risk is that pent-up demand for durable and capital goods and a pick-up in household formation rates could help output growth to strengthen even faster than projected.</p>

Nonetheless, the recovery is set to gain momentum only slowly. Supportive area-wide financial conditions, further monetary accommodation and improving external demand should all help to boost activity. The drag from fiscal consolidation is also set to ease modestly this year and in 2015. However, ongoing, though receding, financial fragmentation, still-weak balance sheets and weak labour markets will check growth prospects in many economies. Improving export prospects and a gradual upturn in private investment are expected to help the recovery strengthen, but private consumption is projected to remain subdued throughout this year and next. The large negative output gap is set to close only slowly, with the area-wide unemployment rate remaining above 11Â¼ per cent until the latter half of 2015. GDP growth in Germany, Austria and a number of smaller economies, including Ireland, is projected to be a âÂ percentage point or more above that for the area as a whole. </p>

Scope also exists for monetary policy easing should downside financial risks materialise.

One new source of concern is that disinflationary pressures in some OECD economies, especially in the euro area, could persist or intensify further in the event of a negative demand shock, further currency appreciation or a downward drift in inflation expectations. In addition, downside risks persist from: the interaction of financial vulnerabilities in several EMEs; the planned and necessary exit from highly accommodative monetary policy in the United States and uncertain prospects in China. Geopolitical uncertainty has also been increased as a result of the events in Ukraine, with the downside risk that this could have a significant adverse impact on growth, especially in many Central and Eastern European economies. Other long-standing risks remain, with possible adverse developments stemming from fragilities in the euro area and fiscal challenges in Japan. On the upside, the recovery could prove to be more robust than expected, particularly if: pent-up demand helps to boost future growth in the United States; the Asset Quality Review helps to improve confidence in euro area banks; and cash-rich corporations boost investment by more than projected as the recovery deepens. </p>

The unemployment rate has continued to decline, by around 1Â¼ percentage point over the past year, in part reflecting the expiry of the extended unemployment benefits programme in January. Long-term unemployment (over 1 year) remains high, but short-term unemployment (under six months) is almost back to pre-crisis rates. Although the rate remains very low, the decline in labour force participation has recently eased, with some previously-discouraged workers returning to the labour force. OECD estimates suggest that the present cyclical shortfall in the participation rate (for those aged 15 and over) may be only around 1Â percentage point, with this set to be eliminated over the next 18 months given the economic growth outlook and demographic trends. With steady job growth projected to persist, the unemployment rate could decline further to below 6% by the end of next year. Wage pressures could continue to pick up relatively quickly, as some empirical work suggests that short-term unemployment has a stronger influence on wage setting than long-term unemployment (Krueger et al., 2014), possibly reflecting insider-outsider effects. However, sizeable additional economic slack also remains from involuntary part-time employment, with the share of these workers in the labour force currently around 2 percentage points higher than in the pre-crisis years (<xref refid="IDe03aa60c-9f44-4522-947f-c25cb3fdb745" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).<fnote id="ID-42-1015173"><p id="IDe4390c9f-eafe-4afd-948a-7edb44d8780f" indent="y" numbering="n">This includes workers who are unable to find a full-time job and those who are unable to work more hours due to slack work or business conditions.

However, if output growth remains sufficient to keep the unemployment rate below the OECD estimate of the long-term sustainable rate, as projected, regular wage growth should pick up, with total compensation per employee projected to rise by around 1Â½ per cent this year and 2Â½ per cent in 2015. Yet-to-be tackled reforms to raise product market competition and to increase trade openness would boost medium-term growth and employment prospects still further. </p>

Efforts to improve labour utilisation by reforming labour market regulations and welfare systems have recently intensified in a number of OECD economies (OECD, 2014), particularly in many euro area countries under stress. Additional reforms are needed to strengthen and redesign active labour market and social policies so as to cushion the near-term effects of high unemployment and improve the matching of workers and jobs, especially in many European countries and the United States, where the expiry of extended unemployment benefits in January 2014 reinforces the need for such measures. Reforms of disability benefit schemes are also required in the United States to moderate the fall in labour force participation.<fnote id="ID-42-1015318"><p id="ID927a9c0c-7fd7-4f3c-a310-500285f84128" indent="y" numbering="n">The drop in the US labour force participation rate in recent years has coincided with a significant inflow into disability benefit schemes, with the share of the population of 20-64 year olds receiving disability benefits rising to around 7Â¼ per cent, close to levels in many European economies. This suggests that eligibility requirements may need to be tightened and rehabilitation services strengthened.</p></fnote> In several economies, especially Japan, reforms to improve childcare services and reduce tax and benefit disincentives to second earners would encourage higher female labour force participation. Product market reforms to relax regulatory restrictions in sectors in which there is a strong potential for new job growth could also help improve labour market outcomes, including in Japan, Canada, Germany and France. </p>

          <p id="ID31c9f427-76d2-4e62-acd2-ab51d0f8410b" indent="y" numbering="n">Core inflation in the United States seems likely to drift up slowly to approach the inflation target of 2% by the end of 2015, as economic slack is eroded and cost pressures begin to strengthen. In the euro area, core inflation is more likely to remain soft given anticipated growth prospects and subdued labour cost growth, rising only to 1.2% (annualised rate) by the latter half of 2015, remaining well below the ECB definition of price stability. In Japan, the year-on-year rate of core consumer price inflation is now around Â¾ per cent, helped by strong import price growth, and longer-term inflationary expectations have risen. The increases in the consumption tax rate in 2014 and planned for 2015 will also raise the consumer price level by around 2 percentage points and 1.4Â percentage points, respectively. However, abstracting from this, a durable rise in inflation will require regular wage growth to pick up substantially. This has yet to occur, but with a tighter labour market helping wage growth to strengthen over the next 18 months, the annualised quarterly rate of core inflation, abstracting from indirect tax increases, could be close to 1Â½ per cent by the final quarter of 2015.</p>

          <p id="IDe6f3869a-78e9-414e-9eb5-d754bc6f31e5" indent="y" numbering="n">Despite sluggish growth, underlying inflationary pressures remain substantial in many large EMEs, including India and Brazil. Sizeable exchange rate depreciations have pushed up import prices markedly and inflation expectations are not fully anchored. These factors should start to ease as monetary policy tightening impacts fully on the economy, provided financial market pressures do not intensify once more. In India, consumer price inflation has already fallen sharply, to around 8%, as food price inflation eased to more normal levels after a period of poor weather and an adjustment to administered prices, and is projected to continue easing through the next 18 months, to a little over 6Â½ per cent in 2015, helped by the small negative output gap. A similar outcome is expected in Brazil, although inflation could still be at or above 5Â¼ per cent through much of next year. In China, headline inflation has edged up to around 2Â½Â per cent, with food price pressures having started to rise. Non-food consumer price inflation remains modest, at close to 1Â½Â per cent. The estimated positive output gap is now small and likely to remain so given projections for output growth, so that core inflation should edge up only marginally from its current level.</p>

Looking ahead, further strong growth of domestic demand is expected to result in a renewed widening of the US current account deficit to 3% of GDP by end-2015. There are some upside risks if the composition of expenditure growth shifts even more towards business investment, which is more import intensive than other expenditure categories. Reforms to reduce the generosity of the tax treatment of interest expenses and fiscal consolidation could help to increase saving by reducing reliance on debt finance. This would improve resource allocation and reduce both the fiscal and external deficits.</p>

This reflects a combination of the persistent large external surpluses of Germany and the Netherlands, and a marked improvement in the external balances of the vulnerable economies. Significant adjustments have occurred in these latter countries, with domestic demand heavily compressed and economic slack and structural reforms combining to bring about improvements in price and cost competitiveness. Ireland, Spain, Italy, and, more recently, Portugal and Greece all now have a current account surplus and all are projected to have a rising surplus through 2014-15, helped by improvements in external competitiveness. Nonetheless, further progress and reforms are needed to help bring down high net external indebtedness in most of these countries and ensure that relative costs achieve levels that are consistent with external debt stability during normal cyclical conditions. Priorities include keeping already-agreed ambitious medium-term fiscal targets and reforms in both labour and product markets to help strengthen productivity and improve price and non-price competitiveness. Reforms are also needed in the external surplus countries to rebalance and strengthen growth, prevent the area-wide adjustment process from being too one-sided, and limit the risks of intensifying disinflationary pressures and further increases in the area-wide external surplus. In particular, a key priority is to further improve domestic investment prospects by undertaking product market reforms to open sheltered sectors such as professional services and network industries. In addition to reforms in specific economies, additional area-wide initiatives to strengthen
competition (such as steps at the EU level to deepen the Single Market) and improve credit availability for firms by strengthening the banking system would foster investment and help to lower the area-wide external surplus.</p>

The depreciation of the yen effective rate helped to boost the investment income balance, but had little impact on the trade balance, which has slipped further into deficit. Imports have surged, reflecting both stronger domestic demand growth and also the high level of energy imports. In addition, the expected boost to export performance from the yen depreciation has not materialised, with exporters preferring to hold prices fixed in foreign currency terms, thereby boosting their profitability. With export growth projected to pick up and fiscal consolidation expected to damp domestic demand growth from the second quarter of 2014, the trade balance is expected to improve over the next 18 months, allowing the overall external surplus to eventually stabilise at about Â¾% of GDP.</p>

With domestic demand growth likely to remain strong relative to demand growth in major trading partners through 2014-15, further modest declines in the external surplus are projected, to around 1Â½ per cent of GDP in 2015, provided that the effective exchange rate does not depreciate significantly. Structural reforms that could further reduce the external surplus by limiting the need for domestic saving include the development of the financial sector and social safety nets. Further progress in these areas is likely as a result of the decisions taken at the Third Plenum.</p>

The turnaround in the trade balance has been particularly rapid in India and Indonesia, in part through one-off measures that may not persist, with smaller adjustments having occurred in South Africa and Brazil. In all of these economies, the external deficit by 2015 is projected to be at leastÂ Â¾Â per cent of GDP or more below that in 2013. Little improvement has so far occurred in Turkey, with the external deficit increasing to 8% of GDP in 2013. With recent policy tightening helping to slow domestic demand growth and improved export performance, the deficit is expect to decline to 6Â½ per cent of GDP this year, before drifting up to 7% in 2015, with the required level of external financing leaving the country vulnerable to shifts in global risk sentiment. In all these countries policy priorities include the need to implement fiscal consolidation where budget deficits are high (as in India), and enact structural reforms to remove supply-side constraints, strengthen domestic growth prospects and improve the incentives for long-term capital inflows, thereby reducing dependence on more volatile short-term capital flows.</p>

Government debt remains high in many countries and is merely expected to stabilise in the OECD over next 18 months (<xref refid="ID-42-1014812" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>), limiting the extent to which fiscal policy can be used to support the economy. In the context of still large estimated output gaps, high unemployment and below-target inflation, this implies that accommodative monetary policy should be maintained. However, with the recovery more advanced in the United States and the United Kingdom, monetary stimulus should be reduced gradually, in contrast to Japan, where additional easing is already planned, and the euro area, where additional accommodation is needed. In China, monetary policy will have to be eased if growth were to slow sharply. Prudential measures should also be used in a timely manner to gradually slow rapid credit expansion and harder budget constraints should be imposed on local governments. In several other EMEs, monetary policy may still have to be tightened and fiscal positions improved.</p>

Nevertheless, caution is needed in withdrawing monetary stimulus, as policy rates are still at or close to the zero lower bound. Notwithstanding the progress achieved in improving the state of public finances, additional sustained consolidation will be needed in several countries in the coming years, calling for some offset from monetary policy. Uncertainty about the post-crisis level of neutral interest rates and the possibility that they might be lower than they used to be prior to the crisis provide another argument for keeping policy rates low. Updated OECD estimates of neutral interest rates (Bouis et al., 2013) indicate that they remained negative in real terms in 2013. Although these estimates are inherently uncertain, they suggest that policy interest rates at zero output gaps and on-target inflation could remain lower for longer than in the past. </p>

Policy accommodation is required as current economic slack remains large (with the negative output gap estimated at 3Â½ per cent of GDP in 2013), inflation is low and inflation expectations are well anchored. However, a reduction in monetary policy stimulus will be needed given the projected narrowing of output and unemployment gaps and the projected increase of inflation towards its target. There are risks that prolonged strong monetary accommodation could unanchor inflation expectations and generate asset price bubbles once again. The path set by the Federal Reserve for reducing monthly purchases of securities from the $55 billion in April to zero later this year seems appropriate and it would allow policy rates to start rising in 2015 as currently envisaged by FOMC members and expected by markets. With the unemployment rate declining close to 6Â½ per cent, the Federal Reserve rightly modified its forward guidance in March by removing the reference to the initially announced unemployment threshold for considering rate increases, and indicating that a broad and transparent set of indicators would be considered, including indicators on labour and financial markets and inflation. It also stated that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate <shortcitation>for a considerable time</shortcitation> after the asset purchase programme ended, especially if projected inflation remained below the 2% target, and longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. This shift from state-contingent to qualitative criteria reflects the fact that guidance should be employed during a gradual normalisation of monetary policy to smooth market expectations rather than to provide extra stimulus. </p>

Even if the latest decisions to reduce Federal Reserveâs asset purchases did not trigger a bond sell-off similar to the one observed in mid-2013, and investors see increasingly differentiated risks across EMEs (see above), there is still a risk of an abrupt increase in US bond yields and ensuing spillovers to other countries, especially EMEs (Rawdanowicz et al., 2014). To avoid overshooting of yields and unsettling financial markets at home and abroad, the Federal Reserve will have to normalise its interest rates and asset holdings at a measured pace and prepare investors for this by a carefully-designed communication strategy. For example, the Federal Reserve could consider providing guidance on the path of the policy rate towards its medium-term level and the time profile for an eventual normalisation of its balance sheet. The normalisation process will be a difficult balancing act in view of persisting, albeit diminished, downside risks and fiscal headwinds, and uncertainties about longer-lasting impacts of the crisis on productive capacities, neutral interest rates and monetary policy transmission. </p>

Fiscal consolidation is slowing markedly this year and uncertainty about the near-term fiscal path has also declined. Fiscal drag, estimated at 1Â¾ perÂ cent of GDP in 2013, is projected to amount to only around âÂ perÂ cent of GDP in both 2014 and 2015 (<xref refid="ID-42-1014812" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). This is partly due to the Bipartisan Budget Act enacted in December 2013 which replaced the 2014 spending cut scheduled under sequestration with a slight increase in the spending cap for 2014 and 2015. The Act also reduced the likelihood of surprises to the medium-term path of federal spending: after 2015 discretionary spending is expected to follow the path laid out under sequestration. The early February debt ceiling increase resolved the final important source of fiscal policy uncertainty for at least the next year, as the next debt limit deadline will probably fall toward end-2015. The relative ease with which the increase was enacted also gives hope that future fiscal deadlines may be less disruptive than has been the case over the last few years. Looking out to the longer term, legislators have yet to agree on a programme of spending cuts, including entitlement reforms, or revenue increases to address the pressures that rising health-care costs and an ageing population will put on the public finances.</p>

However, from next year, the policy rate should be increased gradually, as currently expected by markets, to ensure price and financial stability. By the end of 2015, the employment and output gaps are projected to be largely closed and inflation will be close to the target, while policy rates are likely to be significantly below neutral levels, even if the latter could be lower than prior to the crisis. Monetary policy tightening should be accompanied by timely prudential measures to address the risks of excessive house price inflation.

The authorities have specified numerical targets in the new growth strategy aimed at increasing Japan's potential growth rate to 2% (OECD estimates of the current rate are about Â¾ per cent), but it is not clear how these objectives are to be achieved.<fnote id="ID-42-1015498"><p id="ID11d65ac5-a28b-4060-a91d-cb2c30c5d270" indent="y" numbering="n">Even if the targets were to be achieved, they may not suffice to raise potential growth significantly. For example, the objective of raising the employment rate of women in the 25-44 age group from 68% to 73% in 2020, in part by eliminating waiting lists for childcare centres by 2017, will have relatively modest overall effects. On the assumption that the adjustment takes eight years, the overall employment growth rate would be raised by 0.2 percentage point per annum on average and the associated increase in the average annual potential output growth rate would be 0.1 percentage point.</p></fnote> The strategies to reform the agriculture and energy sectors are in line with OECD recommendations (OECD, 2013d), but bolder reforms are urgent. They should involve fundamental changes in product markets, including greater international openness, to strengthen competition and spur efficiency gains and innovation, especially in the service sector where productivity has lagged behind. The OECD's product market regulation indicators show that Japan's barriers in some network industries are among the highest in the OECD and those in services are far away from best performance, even if they are close to the OECD average, leaving large scope for improvements that would boost living standards and help restore Japan's fiscal sustainability.</p>

          <p id="ID26c64cf9-d2f9-4848-9afe-b143e377a57d" indent="y" numbering="n">Japanâs fiscal stance is turning around sharply, from fiscal easing of some Â¾ per cent of GDP last year to a similar amount of fiscal consolidation in 2014. Given that fiscal contraction this year is largely due to the consumption tax increase, and given the timing and composition of the stimulus package meant to partly offset its negative impact on the economy, as well as other measures like the corporate tax cut, the drag on GDP growth this year should be relatively modest. It will be much larger in 2015, when fiscal consolidation worth close to 1Â¾ perÂ cent of GDP is planned, including a large cut in investment spending which tends to have a high fiscal multiplier. The government approved a new medium-term fiscal plan last August, confirming that it aims to lower the primary budget deficit (relative to GDP) of central and local governments from an estimated 6.7% in the fiscal year just ended to 3.3% in FY 2015, achieve a primary surplus by FY 2020, and thereafter steadily reduce the public debt ratio. It will be challenging to meet the 2015 objective with currently decided policy measures, even under optimistic growth assumptions. In any case, keeping to specific headline deficit objectives may be less important for market confidence than showing steady progress toward fiscal sustainability. The top priority should be to produce a detailed and credible long-term plan of measures to consolidate public finances. The plan should include social security reforms to limit spending increases, particularly in the areas of health and long-term care, as well as revenue increases. Such a plan will be instrumental in reducing the risk of an abrupt shift in market sentiment that could fuel a spiral of adverse market reactions (OECD, 2013b). Given the already very high level of government debt, a rise in the real yields of sovereign bonds, or disappointing growth outcomes, would seriously aggravate
debt dynamics.</p>

However, inflation is still below target and is expected by the OECD to remain so (excluding the consumption tax increase effects) at least until end-2015. Thus, it is appropriate to keep increasing the already large monetary policy stimulus over the medium term as planned. If inflation were to undershoot its target persistently and the economic slowdown were to turn out to be greater than expected, boosting quantitative and qualitative monetary easing even further than currently envisaged (i.e.Â doubling of the monetary base between end-2012 to end-2015) might be warranted notwithstanding the associated risks. This could involve larger purchases of longer-term government and private bonds, rather than expanding the two loan support programmes, as done recently. These loan programmes may entail inefficiencies as high funding costs and a lack of access to funds do not seem to hinder banksâ credit provision, and loans targeted to selected sectors in one of the programmes raise concerns about resource misallocation and an uneven playing field. </p>

Banksâ balance sheets have been improving gradually and banks have raised capital (EBA, 2013), resulting in lower CDS spreads and higher equity valuations. Nevertheless, deleveraging and recapitalisations are not finished and impaired assets are still rising. The comprehensive assessment should be used as an opportunity to provide reliable estimates of capital needs and be followed by swift recapitalisations or, if necessary, resolutions. If this were to be the case, credit conditions offered by banks could ease (<xref refid="ID-42-1015002" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>), with an upside risk for the momentum of the recovery. Thresholds to assess capital adequacy in terms of core tier 1 capital were chosen at 8% of risk-weighted assets in the baseline scenario and 5.5% in the adverse scenario (ECB, 2014c). They reflect the prevailing regulatory minimum requirements and seem appropriate given the demanding macroeconomic scenarios employed (ECB, 2014d).<fnote id="ID-42-1015696"><p id="ID43f40c0f-e574-4e1b-8235-42e7036cb35f" indent="y" numbering="n">Regulatory requirements will be, however, more stringent with the full implementation of the EU Credit Requirements Regulation/Directive 4. As of 2019, EU banks will have to apply a more restrictive definition of core tier 1 (CT1) capital and meet CT1 requirements in terms of risk-weighted assets between 7% and 14.5% (4.5% main capital ratio + 2.5% conservation buffer + 0-2.5% countercyclical buffer + 0-5% macro-prudential systemic risk buffer, which will include the 1-3.5% buffer for global systemically important
financial institutions).</p></fnote> It would be, however, desirable to report leverage ratios under the adverse scenario, given the evidence that this indicator has more predictive power for financial stress than risk-weighted capital ratios.<fnote id="ID-42-1015765"><p id="ID9fa37638-1305-4d6e-869a-fa6d40ac14c6" indent="y" numbering="n">See Blundell-Wignall and Roulet (2012 and 2013) and Haldane and Madouros (2012).

To minimise the risk of renewed tensions, it is crucial to clarify how any identified capital shortfalls of viable banks will be rectified.<fnote id="ID-42-1015834"><p id="ID9003a153-9e46-4b36-8ee0-5516f9f9012f" indent="y" numbering="n">The ECB announcement of the comprehensive assessment recognised the potential need for public backstops, but stressed that capital shortfalls should be made up primarily by private investors (ECB,Â 2013b).

At the same time, lower financial market pressure creates a risk that consolidation efforts become confined to stabilising public debt burdens rather than restoring room for active fiscal policy to counter future shocks. After structural fiscal consolidation of just over Â½ per cent of GDP inÂ 2013, area-wide consolidation is expected to amount to a bit less than Â½ per cent of GDP both this year and next. In Germany, the fiscal stance is expected to be slightly expansionary over the projection period. In France, the pace of consolidation is slowing slightly, to about Â¾ perÂ cent of GDP both this year and next. Italyâs fiscal stance will only be slightly contractionary in 2014 and 2015. Spain, Portugal and Ireland are planning larger fiscal efforts (between 1% and 1Â¾ per cent of GDP) and do not have room for a gentler approach. Greece is sharply reducing the pace of fiscal consolidation now that it enjoys a primary surplus. Some countries have now completed most of their required structural fiscal adjustments, while others, like Spain, Ireland and France, will need to continue well beyondÂ 2014. In these countries, the automatic stabilisers should be allowed to operate fully around planned structural consolidation paths. Governments should also avoid relaxing fiscal adjustment efforts relative to the structural commitments they have made even if there are positive growth surprises or reduced financial market pressure. In particular, large countries should not use improvements in financing conditions brought about by smaller countriesâ fiscal efforts as an excuse to relax their own fiscal adjustments, because a significant risk of renewed market frictions remains.</p>

However, should growth weaken significantly or domestic liquidity conditions tighten sharply, monetary stimulus would be warranted through reductions in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR). In parallel, rising financial stability concerns (<xref refid="ID-42-1014886" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>) should be addressed by financial regulation and macro-prudential measures, ensuring a reduction in off-balance sheet credit growth whilst avoiding a sharp slowdown in economic activity. The deregulation of interest rates is expected to be completed within two years, with the abolition of the deposit rate cap this year bringing lending and deposit rates closer to market-clearing levels and weakening the attractiveness of shadow banking products. This effect could be strengthened by reducing the currently high RRR (20% for big and 16.5% for small and medium-size financial institutions) which disadvantages regular commercial banks. As recently proposed by the authorities, deposit insurance and a resolution system for financial institutions will precede full liberalisation. Better monitoring and control of risks in the shadow banking sector is also needed.</p>

In April, the State Council announced a small targeted fiscal stimulus package to support near-term growth. Further fine-tuning measures might follow if momentum continues to falter. Recent survey results on local government debt placed it at 33.2% of GDP in June 2013, an increase of 6Â½ percentage points in 2Â½ years.<fnote id="ID-42-1015957"><p id="IDb8f039b0-788d-4fb1-b4d1-a2e5de64ba33" indent="y" numbering="n">The increase may be somewhat overstated because of a finer coverage in the most recent survey.</p></fnote> Adding central government debt, Chinaâs total government debt was about 56% of GDP in June 2013.

The central government has not yet provided an explicit resolution scheme if problems occur. As laid out in the 3rd Plenum report and proposed at the National Peopleâs Congress last March, the central government should impose harder budget constraints on local governments, improve transparency, and enhance monitoring of local government expenditures.</p>

Diverging trends in inflation and GDP growth call for differentiated policy responses. The current monetary policy stance is appropriate in Russia, and should be eased gradually in Indonesia and possibly India and South Africa, but in Brazil, where inflation is not expected to decline in the near term, further tightening is desirable. Additional increases in policy rates would be, however, needed if currencies were to depreciate further and inflation outcomes and expectations were to increase. This would pose a policy dilemma given already subdued growth in many EMEs and the limited scope for offsetting fiscal stimulus, notably in India, where high government deficits need to be brought down, and in Brazil, where the fiscal position must improve durably to reinforce the credibility of fiscal announcements. Nevertheless, weaker currencies and higher policy rates could help rebalance the economy towards exports and improve current account balances, as recently experienced in India and Indonesia. Thus, exchange rates should be allowed to adjust flexibly to changing fundamentals, though transparent and temporary interventions may play some role in reducing short-term currency volatility and financial instability. </p>

Reducing regulatory burdens on foreign direct investment and product markets and removing tax incentives for debt over equity financing should help to bring about a safer structure of foreign liabilities and reduce the risks of volatile capital flows (Ahrend and Goujard, 2012). EMEs should also re-start growth-enhancing structural reforms to help improve their economic prospects more generally and boost investorsâ confidence. In particular, they could raise comparatively low levels of labour productivity by reducing still high regulatory barriers to competition and restrictions to FDI and trade, by developing infrastructure, and by improving access to education and teaching quality (OECD, 2014). </p>

        </heading>
        <p id="IDbf85d4fa-ee45-4259-b9bd-6ddc14d675cd" indent="y" numbering="n">The following table and set of diamond charts show the position of OECD and non-OECD countries on a number of indicators that could reveal potential exposure to financial turbulence. The main focus of the table is on domestic vulnerabilities of OECD and BRIICS countries, that of the diamonds on financial account vulnerabilities of OECD and non-OECD G20 countries.</p>
        <p id="ID74bba2ad-4edf-49df-93b5-75efe355f835" indent="y" numbering="n">The table presents indicators typically associated with financial vulnerabilities (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> International Monetary Fund, 2012; European Commission, 2012) arising primarily from the domestic economy in four broad categories: the real economy, the non-financial sector, the financial sector and public finances. Possible weaknesses in the real economy are captured by the difference between the potential and the actual GDP growth rate, the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment (or NAIRU), the current account deficit and the evolution of relative unit labour costs. Indicators of financial market excesses related to the non-financial sector are debt of households and non-financial corporations and real house price growth. Core Tier-1 capital additions required to reach 5% (without any normative implications) of total assets in each of the countryâs selected banks, non-performing loans, and financial corporationsâ debt are included to account for the direct risk exposure of the financial sector. The calculations of the Core Tier-1 capital additions are based on over 1200 commercial banks, including 915 in the United States, 197 in the OECD euro area countries, 23 in the United Kingdom, 11 in Canada and 7 in Japan. Vulnerabilities stemming from the public sector are quantified along three dimensions: government net borrowing, gross government debt and the difference between 10-year sovereign bond yields in real terms and the potential real GDP growth rate. </p>
        <p id="ID791ef38d-56ff-4e01-aec1-117721c09971" indent="y" numbering="n">The four OECD countries with the weakest scores are labelled in dark grey, the four OECD countries with the next weakest scores in light grey. Higher values indicate a larger vulnerability. The table also includes the current sovereign credit ratings issued by Standards and Poorâs.</p>
        <p id="ID759388ea-1ff8-4e18-8b8e-0284a2384952" indent="y" numbering="n">The diamond charts (an updated version of Ahrend and Valdivia, 2012) display financial-accounts-related risk factors to financial stability for OECD and non-OECD G20 countries based on previous OECD empirical analysis (Ahrend and Goujard, 2012a, 2012b). The analysis shows that a bias in gross external liabilities towards debt, in particular bank debt, substantially increases the risk of financial crises (bank debt being defined as debt to a foreign bank). In contrast, a larger share of FDI in gross external liabilities decreases such risk. Shorter banking debt maturities have also been found to increase the crisis risk, mainly by increasing exposure to financial contagion. The size of reserve holdings appears to reduce the probability of crises, whereas neither external assets (excluding reserves) nor liabilities as a share of GDP are found to influence the crisis risk, except when they are exceptionally large.</p>
        <p id="ID722b122b-33de-47e1-a318-f05e25af9f89" indent="y" numbering="n">The diamonds show: <emphasis emph="italic">i)</emphasis> the position of each country in 2013Q3 (or the latest available) along various dimensions of its financial account structure relative to the OECD median, and <emphasis emph="italic">ii)</emphasis> the country-specific change, from 2007 to 2013Q3, on each dimension relative to the 2007 OECD median (for simplicity and without any normative implications). Indicators are measured in multiples of the standard deviation across countries for the variable in question. Larger values indicate a financial account structure that presents a greater risk to financial stability compared with the OECD median.</p>
        <p id="IDaf719a30-a4b0-42b8-a75b-297f70d1957c" indent="y" numbering="n">The main highlights emerging from the analysis include:</p>

            <p id="ID801cb3c9-c730-498d-ad4f-64b6c8ad64fa" indent="y" numbering="n">The least vulnerable OECD countries include Austria, Germany and Poland.</p>

            <p id="ID721f2d51-707f-4b7b-979b-d3d4a00d307c" indent="y" numbering="n">Vulnerable euro area countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Slovenia) score weakly on several indicators, including low growth and high unemployment rates, non-performing loans, public debt and government bond yields. In many of these countries external liabilities exhibit a systematic debt bias (above the OECD median).</p>
          </li>
          <li id="N03F9B6C0N03F4A028" numbering="n">
            <p id="IDe7d69699-9334-46cf-8865-ccb1f3fa3be5" indent="y" numbering="n">There are indications that some OECD countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden) which have suffered relatively little from the global financial and euro area crises are exposed to vulnerabilities stemming from the non-financial sector (most or all from household debt, house prices and relative unit labour costs). On the other hand, their financial sector does not appear to exhibit significant external vulnerabilities, as evidenced by the diamonds.</p>
          </li>
          <li id="N03F9B6C0N03F4A088" numbering="n">
            <p id="ID56cbc6fb-ca67-4e78-8f90-7fd98f92858a" indent="y" numbering="n">Countries with a large financial sector âÂ as, for example, proxied by the size of financial corporationsâ gross debt relative to GDP in TableÂ A1 â tend to exhibit the largest financial-accounts-related risk factors to financial stability (in the diamond charts). These include Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</p>
          </li>
          <li id="N03F9B6C0N03F4A0E8" numbering="n">
            <p id="IDd08745d5-e3b9-497d-843a-da8292b7d96f" indent="y" numbering="n">Overall, the diamonds suggest only modest increases in external financial stability risks for non-OECD G20 countries since 2007. The general exception to this pattern is the relatively short maturity of their external bank debt, which has become more pronounced since 2007, possibly related to increased inflows of foreign capital, and some decline in foreign exchange reserves, raising the risk of more turbulent consequences of capital outflows.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Economic activity is projected to pick up in 2014 once the effects of severe winter weather dissipate. Given ample corporate cash flow and an improved demand outlook, business investment should accelerate significantly. Sizable gains in asset prices have boosted household wealth, which, combined with steady progress on the labour market, should provide support to private consumption and residential investment.</emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Fiscal contraction is creating less of a drag on economic growth, although further consolidation at a slower pace will be needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. Monetary policy appropriately remains very accommodative, with slack remaining in the labour market and inflation remaining weak. The Federal Reserve began the process of reducing the pace of its asset purchases, which should continue through most of 2014. It will be appropriate to keep policy rates low for some time, but they are expected to begin to rise by mid-2015. </emphasis>

Moreover, reversing previous large positive growth contributions, changes in stockbuilding reduced growth by Â½Â percentage point in the first quarter. However, forward-looking indicators, such as investment intentions and business expectations, and rises in measures of consumer and business confidence suggest activity is bouncing back. </p>

This recovery will be facilitated by ample corporate profits, which have been strong, partly reflecting muted wage pressure. Household deleveraging and the rise in asset prices have caused household net wealth to rise significantly, which will help sustain consumption growth. Residential investment should pick up from historically depressed levels, boosted by demand from pent-up household formation, although higher mortgage interest rates have recently tempered activity.</p>

          <p id="ID8899e95d-d6f3-4939-9fe4-f65c30d82628" indent="y" numbering="n">The unemployment rate has fallen steadily since 2009, reaching 6.7% in early 2014, as a result of steady employment growth. In addition, the decline in labour force participation reversed in early 2014 as sizable numbers of people outside the labour forced entered both employment and unemployment. However, the number of long-term unemployed and discouraged workers remains high by historical standards, and a large proportion of workers report working part time due to economic reasons. With the recovery gaining strength and the labour market continuing to work off slack, growth in labour compensation, which has been weak, will gradually become stronger.</p>

          <p id="IDfefb1e7e-b5d9-4e45-9db3-1b16b3a7a254" indent="y" numbering="n">Monetary policy remains very accommodative, as is appropriate given slack in the labour market and weakness in price and wage developments. Inflation has fallen to low rates, though some of the factors behind the fall are likely to be transitory, and wage pressures remain muted. With the recovery gaining ground, the Federal Reserve began to reduce its large-scale asset purchases in January 2014. The gradual reduction in purchases is projected to continue through most of 2014. With the continuing strengthening of the economy, monetary policy accommodation is expected to be removed gradually as the economic situation normalises, and policy interest rates are expected to begin to rise by mid-2015.</p>

          <p id="ID69b39d4c-4ec9-4968-8718-26616ad553bb" indent="y" numbering="n">The political agreement leading to the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act and the subsequent lifting of the debt ceiling reduces uncertainty about fiscal policy for the projection period. Nevertheless, fiscal policy remains a drag on growth. The actual reduction in the pace of consolidation is relatively modest at around 0.25% of GDP in both 2014 and 2015, leading to an improvement in the underlying primary balance of around âÂ per cent of GDP in both years, significantly less than the 1Â¾ per cent of GDP reduction in 2013. According to CBO longer-term projections, spending pressures will re-emerge after 2015, underlining the importance of developing a medium-term strategy to ensure fiscal sustainability. </p>

On the negative side, business investment would rebound less vigorously than projected if firmsâ growth expectations faltered. On the positive side, householdâs stronger financial situation could reduce the savings rate, strengthening consumption more than projected. Economic growth could also be stimulated more robustly than expected by factors such as improved competitiveness and low energy prices. </p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Although an export slowdown has moderated the expansion, improving labour market conditions and stronger business confidence will partially offset the impact of the fiscal tightening scheduled in 2014 and 2015, notably due to the consumption tax hikes. An upturn in exports, as world trade picks up, will also support the expansion, with annual growth projected at around 1Â¼ per cent, helping to push inflation up.</emphasis>

The consumption tax rate should be hiked further to 10% by 2015, as planned. Increasing Japan's growth potential through bold structural reforms is also essential to address the fiscal situation, as is expansionary monetary policy.

However, domestic demand growth has remained robust, helping to reduce the unemployment rate to 3.6%, its lowest in seven years. Household consumption was temporarily boosted by a boom in consumption in anticipation of the hike of the consumption tax rate from 5% to 8% in AprilÂ 2014. Indeed, purchases of five key consumer durable products in March 2014 were nearly double the year-earlier level, before contracting in April.</p>

In addition, corporate income taxes are being cut in 2014. Central government spending in FYÂ 2014 is set to rise by 3.5%, the largest increase since FYÂ 2010, led by rising social spending. The decision on whether to hike the consumption tax rate to 10% in October 2015 will be based on a review of economic conditions at the end of 2014. </p>

The Bank expects to achieve the 2% inflation target in 2015. The new policy appears to have increased inflation expectations, while headline inflation has risen to around 1Â½Â per cent (year-on-year) and underlying inflation moved into positive territory in late 2013. </p>

Tight labour market conditions should lead to wage increases that will support private consumption. Business investment is expected to pick up, encouraged by tax cuts and strong business confidence. On the external side, export growth is set to rise thanks to strengthening world trade and the past depreciation of the yen. Consumer price inflation, excluding the effect of the rise in consumption taxes,Â is projected to reach around 1% in 2015. The current account surplus is projected to fall to 0.2% of GDP in 2014, its lowest level since 1980, reflecting large energy imports, but then widen again in 2015 as domestic demand growth eases.</p>

Sustained growth in the face of needed fiscal consolidation depends on a virtuous circle of rising prices, wages and corporate earnings. However, delaying fiscal consolidation could increase the risk of a run-up in long-term interest rates, which would have serious consequences for the financial sector, fiscal sustainability and output growth, and could have significant spillovers to the global economy. On the external side, there is a risk of slower growth in emerging economies, notably China, Japanâs largest trading partner.</p>

However, more progress on restoring competitiveness is necessary while making the adjustment more symmetric. The net foreign debt positions of vulnerable countries are still large and it will require several years of current account surpluses to reduce them significantly. Countries with large current account surpluses can contribute to rebalancing by implementing competition-friendly reforms, such as reducing entry barriers in domestically oriented service sectors.</p>

Disinflationnary pressures could intensify further in the event of negative demand shocks, further currency appreciation, declines in commodity prices or a downward drift in inflation expectations, potentially restraining household and business spending. Other downside risks include: failure to implement a credible asset quality review and stress tests in 2014 and swift recapitalisation or resolution of banks where necessary; insufficient progress in applying the rules that ensure effective functioning of the credit system; and insufficient progress on structural reforms in both debtor and creditor countries. Geopolitical risks related to the events in Ukraine could have a significant impact in some of the economies in the euro area. However, a successful comprehensive assessment of the banking system and subsequent associated measures, and more rapid progress on institutional and structural reform, could improve financial conditions and confidence further, bringing about a stronger turnaround in macroeconomic activity.</p>

While business investment has also strengthened, it remains at historically low levels, despite low interest rates and strong cash holdings of corporations. Growth of bank lending to the domestic non-financial sector has been weak, especially among large highly leveraged banks, in part because strong corporate profitability has damped loan demand. Strong foreign demand for investment goods, mostly from outside the euro area, has sustained industrial production. Against the backdrop of vigorous activity, employment expanded, strengthening household income and private consumption. Nevertheless, consumer price inflation remained low, reflecting falling energy prices, subdued price developments in euro area trading partners and an appreciated exchange rate. While skill shortages have emerged, rising immigration has damped wage pressures.</p>

Spending on health care, the provision of childcare facilities and public infrastructure will also rise in 2014, although public investment will continue to fall short of depreciation. The basic income tax allowance will be raised. In 2015, some of these measures will increase spending further, but the impact on the government deficit will be offset by higher social security contributions. A small fiscal deficit is projected for 2014 and, reflecting the impact of robust domestic demand growth on tax revenues, a small surplus for 2015. </p>

This will, however, be partly offset by slowing demand growth in emerging economies, notably for investment goods, and some loss of export market share due to stronger wage growth in Germany than in other euro area economies. Business investment is expected to be boosted by low interest rates, high capacity utilisation and improving confidence in the euro area economy. Rising housing permits also point to continued vigorous growth of residential investment. As unemployment is projected to drop further below its structural rate, rising wage growth is expected to strengthen private consumption growth while consumer price inflation could rise to 2Â¼Â per cent in the course of 2015. The current account surplus is projected to decline somewhat, but will remain large by historical standards.</p>

While this new structural consolidation path needs to be strictly adhered to in order to reach Franceâs budget objectives, the automatic stabilisers should be allowed to play freely around it to avoid endangering the recovery. The announced cuts in business taxes and social contributions, which add to the recently introduced corporate tax credit (CICE), should promote employment and investment and boost the competitiveness of French firms, thus supporting activity in both the short and longer term. However, these measures need to be financed by significant spending restraint, including planned reductions in inefficient government spending. Stronger capitalisation of systemically important banks would increase the resilience of the economy to financial shocks.</emphasis>

Exports picked up at the end of 2013 on the back of stronger world trade. The gradual recovery in the euro area, along with an improvement in business confidence, is providing support. Weak import growth, an improvement in the terms of trade and a stronger investment income balance led to a marked reduction of the current account deficit to 1.6% of GDP in 2013, below its peak of 2.2% of GDP in 2012.</p>

          <p id="IDddb9f94f-ef92-4c1d-8fac-5667511b64d1" indent="y" numbering="n">Household confidence and the business climate have improved considerably since hitting a trough in early 2013, although both indicators remain well below their longer-term averages. While the construction sector remains weak, manufacturing production and equipment investment have bounced back, and business managers now foresee a sizeable expansion of investment in 2014. Private consumption has started to recover gradually, even though it weakened somewhat in early 2014 largely due to exceptional circumstances, including a fall in energy use related to the warm winter and policy changes in January that led to frontloading of consumption into late 2013. Although registered unemployment numbers have continued to rise, the standardised unemployment rate stopped increasing at end-2013, thanks to falling youth joblessness owing to government-subsidised contracts. With a tepid recovery to date, and persistent pressures on private-sector job creation due to profits weakness, the only other sign of labour-market strength has been temporary jobs arranged through agencies.</p>

The recently introduced (CICE) tax credit, which effectively lowers employer charges on wages up to 2.5Â times the minimum wage, should support firmsâ ability to respond to this additional demand by gradually improving their competitiveness. Recently announced cuts in social charges and business taxes, which the government will start to implement in 2015, should also provide support to employment, consumption and investment.</p>

The general government deficit decreased to 4.3% of GDP in 2013, slightly over target as weak growth undermined revenues. The public deficit is projected to fall to 3.1% of GDP in 2015, owing to further consolidation measures, including a freeze of government employeesâ wages and social expenditure. Public spending remains high (the second highest in the OECD in relation to GDP), but its growth has declined over recent years and sovereign financing costs have remained stable. In a context of a still fragile recovery, the authorities therefore have room to let automatic stabilisers play freely around the consolidation path required to meet the budget objective. This path foresees a cumulative reduction of the structural deficit of 1Â½Â per cent of GDP in 2014-15. </p>

One risk is that the government might find it politically difficult to implement all the envisaged reforms. On the other hand, stronger confidence and growth would reduce unemployment and the high household saving rate more significantly than projected, thereby strengthening consumption. The results of the Asset Quality Review by the ECB, expected later this year, could boost confidence if they show that French banks have built up adequate capital.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">With weak growth and low inflation, the public debt-to-GDP ratio will not begin to fall before 2016. This leaves Italy still vulnerable to potential market turmoil, and thus it is essential to continue fiscal restraint, based on reducing expenditure as a share of GDP. The new government has announced income tax cuts for 2014, financed by spending cuts and small one-off measures. The tax cut will be reversed in 2015 if corresponding spending cuts are not found. Plans for further structural reforms are welcome, and the government should also ensure effective implementation of earlier reforms.</emphasis>

Consumer confidence has been rising for some time, reaching levels similar to mid-2009, while business confidence has risen too but remains below recent peaks. However, employment continues to fall and unemployment has been rising again. Economic slack is therefore substantial and wage settlements have been subdued. Earnings growth has been low, and consumer price inflation has been falling, partly because of the appreciation of the euro. However, this appreciation has also offset earlier improvements in export price competitiveness.</p>

One consequence of the fall in credit has been weak fixed investment, now around one quarter lower than in 2008. </p>

Given OECD output and inflation projections, the ratio of public debt to GDP is set to flatten out, but not to decline, through the projection period, even adjusted for contributions to the EFSF and ESM. The new government plans to support the recovery with small cuts in personal income tax in 2014, partly financed by cuts in expenditure and a one-off tax on banks, leaving only a small reduction in the structural deficit. The Stability Programme foresees further fiscal consolidation in 2015, with maintenance of the income tax cut dependent on further expenditure reductions, to be confirmed in budget legislation in late 2014. The OECD projections take into account income tax cuts and other measures for 2014, and assume that measures for 2015 will achieve further consolidation, though somewhat less than shown in the Stability Programme.</p>

          <p id="IDcbe1fef6-27de-46ef-acb2-0c7c425ba857" indent="y" numbering="n">Underlying prospects continue to improve. Exports are projected to accelerate as foreign demand increases. Domestic demand will begin to expand, supported also by income tax cuts in 2014. Credit conditions should improve somewhat during 2014, depending on the results of the Asset Quality Review by the ECB, but are expected to support only a gradual recovery in investment. Investment will accelerate somewhat in 2015, partly due to rising export growth. Unemployment should decline by 2015, but only slowly, as the first impact of increased labour demand is likely to be higher hours worked. High unemployment should keep wage settlements modest, but low inflation and some recovery in hours worked will generate income growth and, supported by small income tax cuts, private consumption growth.</p>

Improved market confidence has helped to reduce interest rates on public debt, but risks of adverse financial market reaction to fiscal slippage will persist until public debt is clearly declining relative to GDP. On the positive side, investment, and therefore GDP, could recover more strongly than projected here, especially if the programme for repaying outstanding public trade credit succeeds in giving a substantial boost to the economy.</p>

Policy interest rates are expected to begin to rise in 2015 as economic slack narrows and inflation pressures gradually build up. Further prudential regulation measures should be considered to ensure a balanced housing market recovery. Fiscal consolidation of about 1% of GDP should be implemented in 2015, as planned, to strengthen public finance sustainability.</emphasis>

Consumption is being supported by a very expansionary monetary stance and a strengthening labour market. Despite supportive monetary and financial conditions and gradually strengthening external demand, the contribution of business investment and exports to growth has remained modest. The current account deficit has widened as net external income and exports have disappointed. Firmsâ growing capacity utilisation and rising investment intentions suggest that business investment should continue to accelerate.</p>

Nevertheless, subdued nominal wage growth and signs that some employees would prefer to work longer hours suggest slack remains in the labour market. Active labour market, education and lifelong learning policies more aligned with developments in labour demand would reduce labour mismatches and sustain growth in the medium term. </p>

Clear communication, including regarding the conditions for the unwinding of credit easing andâquantitative easing policies, is key to an orderly exit from very accommodative monetary policy.</p>

Macro-prudential measures are rightly being taken to restrain housing demand financed by bank debt. For instance, household lending was made ineligible for the Funding for Lending scheme in November 2013. The government has also announced plans to extend residential property taxes, which should further reduce housing demand. Additional use of macro-prudential and other tools to help ensure a balanced recovery in the housing market and contain household leverage should be considered, including tighter access to the Help to Buy programme and the introduction of higher capital requirements or low maximum loan-to-value ratios for mortgages. </p>

          <p id="ID459604b6-bf29-4c7b-b6f4-521c0a1ecab3" indent="y" numbering="n">There is a downside risk that micro-prudential and macro-prudential policies are ineffective in containing the housing market, resulting in overheating. The recent decision to allow higher lump-sum withdrawals of pension assets could further stimulate household spending, property demand and house price inflation. Small businesses still have difficulties accessing bank finance, which could hamper the investment recovery. More generally, growth may not sufficiently broaden to exports, investment and labour productivity, while interest rate normalisation could have a stronger-than-expected impact on balance sheets owing to high levels of indebtedness. On the other hand, growth might turn out to be more balanced if large corporations use their large cash surpluses to increase business investment more than projected. Wages could pick up in line with stronger productivity, which would support household incomes and living standards.</p>

Exports are set to gain momentum, supported by stronger foreign-market growth, the recent currency depreciation and continuing energy-sector expansion. Business investment should also accelerate, boosting capacity and cost competitiveness. Consumption growth is likely to strengthen, while housing investment should decline towards a more sustainable level. With economic slack fully absorbed, inflation is projected to rise to nearly 2% by late 2015.</emphasis>

Private consumption continues to lead the way. Residential investment, on the other hand, has been declining since late 2013, and the downward trend in building permits points to further falls from its current high level. Following a strong recovery from the recession, business investment has been weak since early 2012. However, investment intentions are positive, albeit restrained by uncertainty about the economic outlook, and machinery and equipment imports have increased. Non-commodity exports have been growing almost as fast as Canadaâs export markets, a marked improvement on the large market-share losses up to 2011. Even so, exports have languished, mainly reflecting slow growth in export markets.</p>

Gains in annual real hourly compensation remain in a 1.5-2% range, but unit labour cost increases have slowed to around 0.5%, reflecting higher productivity growth. Headline and core inflation have stayed near the lower end of the official 1-3% target range, largely owing to remaining economic slack. The Bank of Canada estimates that heightened competition in the retail sector will temporarily reduce inflation by 0.3Â percentage points in 2014, with the effects largely dissipating by around the middle of 2015.</p>

In its 2014Â budget, the federal government reaffirmed its commitment to eliminate its deficit (which was 0.9% of GDP in 2013/14) by 2015/16. Most of this reduction will come from further spending restraint. Provincial governments have announced budgets that would reduce their combined deficits by 0.4% of GDP over the same period. On the basis of these budget plans, this projection assumes a cumulative structural consolidation of 1.4% of GDP over calendar years 2014-15. </p>

This monetary support is important for a continued recovery, but the consequent search for return by investors requires close prudential oversight of asset markets, particularly that for housing. Tellingly, investors account for much of the recent increase in the number of housing-loan approvals. Prudential measures on mortgage lending should not be ruled out as a targeted means to cool the market. </p>

Spending commitments already in the pipeline imply reaching this goal requires a deficit reduction of approximately half a percentage-point of GDP each year, on average (abstracting from a one-off grant to the RBA to re-stock a buffer fund). Some of the deficit reduction will happen automatically as growth picks up and if bracket-creep is allowed to operate. However, active measures will also be required and these are due to be revealed in the 2014/15 budget in mid-May. </p>

Â Faster growth in housing construction and in some categories of resource exports where capacity has been increased will also play a role. Nevertheless, remaining economic slack will keep inflation moderate. The on-going shift away from resource-sector investment will mean comparatively low employment growth, with the rate of unemployment peaking above 6%. The deficit is projected to increase in 2014, partly due to the one-off grant to the RBA, and then fall in 2015. </p>

The projection assumes that the capital transfers and the assumption of liabilities associated with the recent decision to establish an entity to wind down impaired bank assets will push up the headline budget deficit and public debt by 1% and 5% of GDP, respectively, in 2014. Additional public transfers may be needed for other (partly) nationalised banks. A recently enacted tax package, including reductions of tax expenditures and increases in indirect taxes, will help maintain the budget on a structural consolidation path and at least partly offset additional spending on family benefits, pensions, other stimulation measures and debt interest payments.</p>

Credit growth remains weak but strengthening confidence, continued euro-area monetary support and high firm cash reserves will result in rising investment. Inflation, which has been considerably above the euro area average (partly due to excise tax hikes early in 2014), is projected to abate in the course of 2014, supporting real income gains. The labour market will remain weak in 2014, holding back household income growth. However, once the recovery gains pace a stronger labour market should support higher consumption growth from the end of 2014. </p>

This could lead to reductions in bank assets. On the upside, a stronger-than-projected recovery in Austriaâs trading partners and a quicker restoration of confidence in the wake of further progress on the euro-area banking union could lead to a stronger pick-up of exports and domestic demand.</p>

Active labour market policies should be enhanced to avoid unemployment becoming entrenched.</emphasis>

In early 2014, inflation fell to 0.2%, well below the National Bank's 2% target, reflecting the slack in the economy and a sharp decline in administered prices. Inflation is expected to rebound to within the central bankâs tolerance band of 1% to 3%, as the effects of the weaker koruna feed through and the cuts in administered prices no longer affect year-on-year inflation. The need for the exchange rate floor is thus likely to diminish soon. </p>

However, the headline general government deficit is expected to rise in 2015 due to the end of one-off revenues related to changes in pension taxation. In the future, the early retirement reforms of the past few years are expected to benefit public finances. </p>

The government has announced fiscal tightening totalling more than 1% of GDP over the next four years, of which nearly three quarters is to take place in 2015. Tax increases and expenditure cuts, each accounting for about half of the consolidation package, will likely weaken growth in the short term. The governmentâs structural reform programme needs to be implemented to raise growth and restore long-term fiscal sustainability. The recently announced reform to reduce the fragmentation of health and social care can be expected to contribute to that objective.</p>

In particular, events in Ukraine imply great uncertainty for Finnish exports. Higher than foreseen international demand for investment goods would particularly benefit Finland. As the economy restructures, emerging economic sectors may progressively strengthen, partly compensating the structural decline in electronics and forestry. Exports could also benefit more than expected from improving price competitiveness, as a result of agreements on low wage increases over the next two years.</p>

For 2014-15, the overall budget deficit is projected to exceed somewhat the official targets due to lower projected growth and assuming that automatic stabilisers will operate. Achieving public debt sustainability will require robust growth in the coming years and further fiscal consolidation, although the pace of consolidation will be less than in the past. Encouraging stronger growth also requires further structural reforms to boost competition, and better access to credit through restructuring bank balance sheets. At the same time, given the severe social consequences of the crisis, policy must continue to focus on fairly sharing the costs and benefits of the adjustment.</p>

In particular, lifting capital controls would send a positive signal to foreign investors.</emphasis>

Gross fixed capital formation (excluding volatile items, such as ships and aircraft) also increased strongly, while private consumption and government spending grew at slower rates. Buoyant exports, weak imports and a much lower deficit in primary income from abroad all contributed to a large current account surplus of over 5% of GDP in adjusted terms (i.e. excluding the transactions of banks being wound up), among the highest surpluses recorded since the compilation of national accounts started in Iceland in 1945. Employment benefitted from the dynamism of activity and the unemployment rate declined further. Long-term unemployment has improved, but youth unemployment remainsÂ high. </p>

The general government deficit declined to 2.1% of GDP in 2013, through a combination of strong tax revenues and spending restraint. The government aims to reduce the deficit further to about 1% of GDP in 2014-15. Significant tax policy changes are introduced in the 2014 budget. The tax levied on the total debt of credit institutions will be raised further, while the tax pressure on middle-income and low-income households will be lightened through a combination of a lower tax rate and a higher basic income deduction. On the spending side, the government decided to cancel various investment projects and new entitlement programmes, and introduced an across-the-board cap of 1.5% on spending growth.</p>

Exports are expected to slow towards a pace more consistent with Icelandâs external market growth and level of competitiveness. By contrast, private consumption will be supported by the governmentâs household debt relief programme. Business investment will benefit from the realisation of projects in the pharmaceutical and tourism sectors (several hotels are planned). This more domestically-driven pattern of growth will help eliminate the current account surplus (on an underlying basis) and reduce imbalances in the economy. </p>

Despite that cut and the bankâs currency market interventions, the shekelâs appreciation has continued, reaching 5Â½Â per cent year-on-year in effective nominal terms in March. In addition, the rules for granting housing loans were tightened to avoid property market overheating, as prices had already risen by over 6% (year-on-year) in DecemberÂ 2013.</p>

Cutting the deficit to 3% of GDP in 2014 should be achieved, despite cancellation of the initially scheduled income tax hikes. To scale this deficit back to 2.5% of GDP in 2015, the authorities have decided to lower the growth target for real government outlays to 2.6%. This may, however, put too tight a squeeze on civilian expenditure, which is already low by international standards.</p>

An improving international environment combined with continued low interest rates will gradually compensate for budget restrictiveness and currency appreciation. Foreign tradeâs knock-on effect on activity, which will be bolstered by expanding gas production in 2014, should spur non-residential investment. Residential construction could also benefit from measures to overcome housing bottlenecks, in particular better co-ordination of government interventions. These developments should gradually spur job creation and ensure that unemployment stays low. Although up slightly, inflation should remain well within the target range of 1-3%.</p>

The lifting of controls on the housing market, introduced in 2007, contributed to an increase in residential investment for the first time in seven years, while the fall in housing transactions has been reversed. However, private consumption remains subdued, due in part to household debt, which reached 161% of disposable income by endâ2013. Export growth has also been relatively sluggish, reflecting in part the 8% appreciation of the won in trade-weighted terms since midâ2013. Inflation has fallen to around 1% (year-on-year), while the current account surplus increased to 5.4% of GDP in 2013. </p>

In addition, it aims to cut the ratio of household debt to disposable income by 5Â percentage points by 2017, in part by restructuring the debt of delinquent households. The central government budget deficit (excluding the social security surplus, which is close to 3% of GDP) is to be gradually reduced from around 1Â½Â per cent of GDP in 2013 to 0.4% in 2017, while avoiding any tax increases. With public social spending increasing at a double-digit pace, this requires strict spending limits in other expenditure categories. On a general government basis (which includes social security and local governments), a small budget surplus is expected in 2014-15, which would help keep gross government debt below 40% of GDP. Meanwhile, the central bank has kept the policy interest rate unchanged at 2.5% since MayÂ 2013.</p>

In addition, the negative impact of the new EU VAT regime on Luxembourgâs position in the eâcommerce industry could be larger than expected. Changes in financial sector regulation could require some Luxembourg banks to adapt their business model to the new environment. At the same time, larger safe haven capital inflows might boost activity in the large financial sector.</p>

Last Octoberâs implementation of macro-prudential limits on banksâ mortgage loans has been surprisingly successful in limiting such lending. </p>

The unemployment rate increased slightly and inflation remained just below the 2.5% target. Interest rate policy has been supporting aggregate demand, while the authorities have introduced macro-prudential measures to reduce the risk of financial imbalances. The housing market has cooled, though prices seem to have levelled out in early 2014, after falling since mid-2013. It is not yet clear whether this marks a successful stabilisation of the housing market. Growth in household debt has declined recently, even though its level remains high. The household saving ratio has risen to high levels, but is expected to level off. </p>

Fiscal policy will be more expansionary under the new government, through cuts in taxes on household income and more infrastructure spending. The non-petroleum structural deficit is projected to increase by half a percentage point of mainland GDP in 2014. While a small loosening of fiscal policy is appropriate in current circumstances, the authorities should continue to keep the non-petroleum structural budget deficit at a lower level than allowed under the guidelines, which specify a non-petroleum structural deficit of no more than 4% of the value of the sovereign wealth fund (Government Pension Fund Global, GPFG). Keeping the structural deficit appropriately well below (under 3% of the GPFG in 2014) helps to avoid excessive stimulus which could lead to overheating and damage competitiveness.</p>

This should be enough to begin absorbing economic slack and raise inflationary pressures. Accordingly, the central bank is assumed to start to gradually increase its policy rate towards the end of 2014. </p>

Bank balance sheets are also improving. However, firms face high borrowing costs and difficulties in accessing credit, partly because they are already highly indebted. Banks are providing easier credit access to the tradeable than to the non-tradeable sectors, which is helping the economy to rebalance away from domestic demand. Non-performing loan ratios remain high at 11.8% on average, and are significantly higher in the non-tradeable sectors. </p>

Fiscal consolidation should continue at a slower pace, as planned. Although it would be desirable to allow the automatic stabilisers to work, this would require Parliament to overrule the constitutional debt ceiling. In the medium term, the authorities should ensure that enough room is generated under the debt ceiling to allow automatic stabilisers to work without triggering the constitutional rule provisions. Improved tax collection, stronger consumption and rising incomes will all expand the tax base. However, the importance of one-off budgetary measures (such as revenues coming from the auction of a telecommunication frequency band and sales of state property) raises concerns regarding the sustainability of fiscal consolidation. The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to stay just below the constitutional debt ceiling of 57% of GDP in 2014 and 2015, taking into account one-offs and planned privatisation revenues.</p>

It could also be weakened by events in Ukraine. The particularly large share of domestic government bonds held by banking sector is a negative risk for credit growth. On the other hand, steps to implement a comprehensive banking union in the euro area, including a fiscal backstop, more quickly could reduce uncertainty. This will contribute to boosting and rebalancing lending towards the corporate sector, in particular to finance start-up investment. </p>

Active labour market policies could be strengthened and labour market duality reduced further.</emphasis>

Nevertheless, the state of the banking sector remains fragile as non-performing loans are high and credit to the over-leveraged corporate sector is falling. Restructuring of companies and consolidation in the banking sector is yet to start in earnest. A tight fiscal stance and a weak labour market continue to weigh on demand. </p>

For the other five banks, the shareholders are required to meet capital needs, but there is still a risk that additional recapitalisation of up to 2% of GDP will fall on the government. The government remains committed to continue with planned privatisation of major banks and insolvency regulation has been reformed to ensure swifter restructuring of companies. These measures calmed financial markets, sovereign bond yields have fallen significantly, and ratings on sovereign and bank debt have improved.</p>

Fiscal consolidation continued in 2013 with cuts in non-wage spending and public sector wages, and increases in some taxes, including VAT, but the headline deficit is deteriorating due to capital injections into banks. The government aims to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by end-2015. However, a court challenge to the new real estate tax planned for 2014 could result in revenues being 0.6% of GDP less than planned. The government has reacted by raising excise duties and further containing spending, and it should firmly stick to its underlying consolidation path, while allowing the automatic stabilisers to work.</p>

Export growth, fuelled by improving prospects in Swedenâs trading partners, is set to contribute increasingly to output growth over the projection period. Household consumption and residential investment will continue to grow in line with incomes. Strong corporate cash positions and rising confidence will boost business investment. The unemployment rate is projected to fall from the second half of 2014, as job creation gathers momentum. Stronger labour market performance will in turn push up wages in 2015, and inflation is projected to begin to rise in late 2015. However, inflation will still be below target and, depending on economic developments, interest rates need to start rising only towards mid-2015.</p>

In addition, on a year-on-year basis investment has returned to growth for the first time since 2011. While all components of investment are growing, construction was up 5.2% in 2013. Thanks to strong employment gains, especially in services and construction, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4%, a level not seen since early 2012.

The effect of the high value of the franc has been visible in goods exports, which fell by 0.5% in 2013. In particular, export-oriented branches such as manufacturing contributed negatively to growth in 2013, in sharp contrast with the situation prior to the appreciation of the currency. Even though monetary policy has been very accommodative and the European economy is slowly improving, the SwissÂ franc has remained strong. However, no official currency intervention has been required of late to maintain the currency ceiling. </p>

Together with sustained internal demand it should push up growth to 2.5% in 2015 and maintain the current account surplus above 10% of GDP. Switzerland should move back to slightly rising prices towards the end of 2014, helped by a slowly closing output gap and by gently rising inflation expectations. By contrast, notwithstanding the introduction of macro-prudential measures in 2013, real estate prices are still increasing quickly: depending on the measure, between 4.7% and 8% annually for owner-occupied apartments and between 2.6% and 7.4% for single-family homes.</p>

The exchange rate ceiling and zero interest rates offer limited scope for further stimulus on the monetary side, should growth dip. At the same time a prolonged period of record-low interest rates is boosting mortgage demand, up 4.3% over the past year, creating a risk of increased imbalances in the housing sector. Years of fiscal prudence have helped Switzerland reduce its public debt, offering room for fiscal action if needed. Finally, expected immigration quotas are unlikely to have any immediate impact on growth, although they may increase uncertainty in the near term.</p>

Under tighter financial conditions, credit growth slowed sharply. However, as employment growth remained buoyant, private demand decelerated only gradually. Faced with a widening current account deficit, policymakers moderated the stimulus imparted through public spending, and, in the last quarter of 2013, introduced new measures to rein in credit card use. Exports were essentially flat, as the pick-up of export markets and competitiveness gains from exchange rate depreciation were offset by sharply declining gold exports. Furthermore, recent political tensions led to a plunge in consumer confidence and business expectations. Following large currency depreciation, rising risk premia and sizeable foreign currency reserve sales, the central bank raised its policy rates by 550 basis points in January, increasing actual funding costs by about 250 basis points. Further measures were introduced in February to restrain consumer credit.</p>

Core inflation is also rising and is above even headline inflation. High inflation should persist in 2014 as a result of additional pass-through from exchange rate depreciation and indirect tax increases, which could erode competitiveness. The current account deficit approached 8% of GDP by late 2013 and, despite progress in rebalancing demand in early 2014, terms of trade losses will likely keep it above 6% for some time. The total external funding needs (to finance the deficit and maturing external debt) remain substantial at around 28% of GDP in 2014. So far there has been disproportionate reliance on short-term external borrowing to finance the current account deficit, with total external debt reaching 47% of GDP inÂ 2013. Improving the business environment in the formal sector by implementing the regulatory reforms envisaged in the 10<sup>th</sup> Development Plan 2014-2018, concerning for example the labour market, could spur FDI inflows and reduce reliance on external debt. </p>

In order to hold confidence up during electoral cycle (presidential elections in AugustÂ 2014 and general elections by JuneÂ 2015), macroeconomic policy should remain transparent and predictable. A timely publication of consolidated general government accounts and full reporting on the activities of quasi-fiscal entities would help to preserve hard-won confidence in the integrity of public finances. Macroprudential measures to keep consumer credit growth in check should be maintained, and the quality of commercial loans should remain under close surveillance. Monetary policy should focus squarely on disinflation to stabilise the economy and minimise competitiveness losses. </p>

If either of them were to materialise, confidence could falter and tensions arise in foreign funding. Moreover, financial stability could be imperilled if funding costs were to rise markedly. Turkey would also be affected negatively by further geopolitical tensions in the MENA region or by weak growth in Russia and Ukraine, which together account for a quarter of exports. On the upside, a firmer restoration of domestic and international confidence and stronger recovery in international trade would bolster growth.</p>

Tighter monetary policy, softer external demand and policy uncertainties due to the presidential election are likely to weigh on activity during 2014. In 2015, GDP growth is projected to rise somewhat, with persistent supply constraints, including a tight labour market, and the need for continued tight macroeconomic policies holding back domestic demand. </emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The central bank has appropriately raised its policy rate to reduce inflation. Keeping inflation expectations anchored will require firm monetary policy action and containing officially directed credit volumes. The planned tightening of fiscal policy in 2014 needs to be implemented. With slow productivity growth, disinflation will have costs in terms of growth and unemployment, but delaying policy action would only raise those costs. Faster increase in infrastructure investment, lower trade barriers and tax reform are all needed to raise potential growth. </emphasis>

Export prospects have been affected by weaker external demand growth, especially for manufactured goods, although the currency depreciation is likely to support exports going forward. </p>

Against the background of stronger pressures from administrative price increases than in 2013, monetary policy will need to continue tightening in 2014 to keep inflation expectations anchored to the target. Postponing disinflation will only raise its costs in terms of output and employment losses, and the central bank should aim at bringing inflation back to the target midpoint earlier than its current 2016 objective. Establishing full central bank independence could support this task, as would lowering the demand pressures stemming from fiscal policy and government-directed credit extended by public and private financial institutions. </p>

The announced rise in the primary surplus target for 2014 is welcome, but it will only affect market expectations if it is backed by a credible commitment. Redesigning the fiscal rule to take account of the business cycle, for example by adopting an expenditure rule, would be one way to do this. Additional options include consolidating fiscal oversight, cutting the automatic link between the fast-rising federal minimum wage and a significant number of social expenditure items, and reducing expenditures on the interest differential of directed loans, which continue to drive overall credit growth. </p>

Although portfolio outflows occurred in late 2013, foreign direct investment inflows and the overall financial account remain firmly positive.

Trust and wealth management products have been subjected to stricter reporting requirements to encourage better pricing of risk. The on-going grassroots interest rate liberalisation has allowed savers to earn higher returns and risky borrowers to get access to funds. However, interconnections between high-yield investment products, major banks, sub-national governments and state-owned firms, along with repeated bailouts, underpin the impression of implicit guarantees. Orderly failure of insolvent investment products would sharpen risk assessments without endangering financial stability. The authorities are committed to step up structural reforms, which need to be pursued amidst deleveraging. Maturity mismatches on- and off-balance sheet imply liquidity risks, which call for the provision of sufficient, but not excessive, liquidity to avoid the reversal of deleveraging. Deposit interest rate liberalisation should be gradual to minimise default risks.</p>

The budget deficit is projected to widen a bit in 2014, but overall gross public debt â including at sub-central levels - is set to remain around 50% of GDP (with central government debt around 20% of GDP). A large part of sub-national debt is accumulated by investment vehicles and is not recorded in government accounts. Income and debt repayments by sub-national government investment vehicles ought to be integrated into the budget to discourage inefficient investment projects and the associated demand for funding. Viable projects should still be financed as sub-national investment is a major driver of urbanisation and growth, but by issuing bonds instead of borrowing through investment vehicles. </p>

Risks are mostly on the downside. Investment may slow more than projected if the supportive measures fail to counterbalance the effects of the phasing out of excess capacity and the anti-corruption campaign. Consumption may also surprise on the downside if a cooling property market were to damp housing-related spending and weak income growth were to curtail spending on durables. Another downside risk relates to potentially disorderly defaults among corporate issuers and trust products. However, a stronger-than-expected global recovery would boost exports, investment and growth. </p>

After contracting in real terms in 2013, investment was still sluggish early in 2014, partly reflecting high corporate leverage in some sectors. Lending to the non-food sector has remained sluggish. The decline in political uncertainty after the general election in spring 2014 should provide a new impetus to investment. While the manufacturing sector has been a drag on the economy, forward-looking indicators, such as industry new orders, point to some recovery. Financial and business services remain buoyant. </p>

The gradual implementation of the subsidy reform â from in-kind to cash transfers coupled with a unique identification number to reduce fraud â has also helped. Still, spending pressures are building up as food and gas subsidies have been made more generous while public spending on education and health remains very low.

On the negative side, failure to halt the rise in non-performing loans could derail the pick-up in investment.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">In contrast to the fragility in a number of other emerging market economies, consumer confidence has firmed in Indonesia. The economy has slowed, and this and stronger exports have helped to narrow the current account deficit in recent months. As a result, current account concerns have dissipated, and the currency has appreciated sharply. Inflation has started to slow, as the impact of fuel subsidy cuts has abated and food prices have eased.</emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The rupiah remains vulnerable to international interest rate movements, but Bank Indonesia can afford to begin to lower its policy interest rates soon. Yet, external balance developments remain highly uncertain, and the authorities should stand ready to respond with monetary and fiscal measures in case of a sudden deterioration. Fiscal policy is broadly expansionary, and even though this yearâs elections may put further pressure on the budget, creating more fiscal room to expand the social safety net should be a priority. Measures also need to be taken to improve international competitiveness, notably by investing in infrastructure.</emphasis>

Despite the scaling down of fuel subsidies, the 2013 deficit was larger than planned due to higher social spending and lower commodity prices. The fiscal balance should remain in moderate deficit.</p>

Whilst supporting the exchange rate has effectively become an important target for monetary policy in the short term, this should not impede the transition to inflation targeting, once the turbulence subsides. </p>

Also, a slowdown in the global economy could put downward pressure on oil and gas prices, which would further weaken domestic demand and undermine public finances. On the positive side, an acceleration of structural reforms could still provide a boost to potential growth despite the negative impact of the crisis on the business climate and economic ties with western economic partners. </p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The government should continue to slowly tighten the fiscal stance as the economy recovers and use cyclical revenue increases to partly reverse recent public debt accumulation. Monetary policy was tightened in response to the continued weakening of the rand, but should remain supportive as inflation pressures are contained by economic slack. Potential growth should be boosted by structural reform that addresses the insider/outsider divide in the labour market and non-competitive product markets, securing faster job creation and more rapid responses to sector-specific supply constraints. </emphasis>

In early 2014, the pace of the economy firmed as mining output accelerated, despite on-going industrial action in the platinum sector that has forced producers to meet demand through de-stocking. This uptick in economic activity has stabilised consumer confidence, which, together with stronger retail sales, points to stronger private consumption growth. On the other hand, private investment softened as confidence weakened and long-term interest rates increased. </p>

This lead to concerns about overshooting of the inflation target. In response, the repo rate was increased by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5%, leading to a nearly 5% appreciation of the rand. Moreover, financial conditions have tightened as long-term rates have increased by 250 basis points. Looking ahead, the monetary policy stance could become more accommodative if inflation expectations remain anchored. </p>

Up until 2030, this is achieved in most countries through already legislated increases in pensionable age, the positive effect of increased education and trend increases in female participation. Beyond 2030 it will require additional reforms to ensure that retirement ages are effectively indexed to life expectancy.</p>

Countries requiring average consolidation beyond 2015 of between 1 and 3 percentage points of GDP are Canada, France, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Portugal.

          <p id="ID9f0bc06a-2a4b-4655-9d5c-f51c8c904c64" indent="y" numbering="n">The global economy will undergo massive changes over coming decades, which will include: a compositional shift in global output towards non-OECD countries and Asia; a further reduction in inequality across countries, although large gaps between the living standards of the poorest and richest nations will remain; and demographic changes in the form of slowing population growth, ageing populations and a narrowing of the gender gap in labour force participation. This chapter attempts to quantify such trends through a consistent set of long-term projections that extend the short-term projections, presented in <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref plu s" refid="ID5aceec07-e926-4a36-a577-ceafa5ec37ec"/> <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref to" refid="ID06ecffca-5e11-4608-9706-9f5d41a32cb3"/>, out to 2060 using the model described in JohanssonÂ <emphasis emph="italic">etÂ al</emphasis>.Â (2013).<fnote id="ID-42-1049145"><p id="ID-42-1049461" indent="y" numbering="n">The cut-off date for data used in the projections for this chapter is 15thÂ AprilÂ 2014.

It also means that recent PPP updates for emerging economies are not incorporated in the projections, although their effect is discussed in the text.</p></fnote> Bearing in mind the substantial caveats that inevitably apply to this form of exercise, these projections are then used as a back-drop for the analyses of fiscal imbalances and consolidation needs and the impact
of structural reforms.</p>

The degree of convergence depends on the starting point, with countries further away from the technology frontier converging faster. Convergence is also influenced by trade openness and by historical inertia. The growth of the technology frontier is assumed to be 1.3 per cent per annum, consistent with the historical growth rate over the decade preceding the crisis in the leading OECD countries, and this is the growth rate to which all countries will converge to in the very long run. In countries where regulations are currently more restrictive, product market and trade regulations are assumed to converge gradually towards the average regulatory stance observed across the OECD, while for other countries regulations remains unchanged.</p>

At a global level, saving and investment are balanced through an equal adjustment in interest rates across all countries; so a tendency towards an <emphasis emph="italic">ex ante</emphasis> <shortcitation>global savings glut</shortcitation> will put downward pressure on interest rates everywhere. For individual countries, excessive government debt or net external debt will push up national interest rates. A range of structural and macroeconomic factors drive national saving rates, but the most important are: demographic, as ageing populations save less; fiscal, as changes in public saving are only partially offset by lower private saving; and, for non-OECD countries, the level of social welfare provision, which reduces the need for precautionary saving. The capital intensity of production, and hence investment, responds to interest rates and so provides a partial equilibrating mechanism between saving and investment and helps to prevent the build-up of excessive national debt (and, equivalently, moderate sustained current account deficits).</p>

For those countries with initial gross general government debt in excess of 60% of GDP, fiscal policy is directed towards convergence on this debt level. Otherwise, for countries where debt is initially below the 60% threshold, fiscal policy is directed to stabilising the gross government debt ratio. To achieve these objectives, fiscal consolidation is assumed to take place through a gradual improvement in the underlying primary balance, with a maximum cap on consolidation in any single year of Â½Â percentage point of GDP. This assumption may contradict current government plans and is not necessarily consistent with national or supra-national fiscal objectives, targets or rules. No allowance is made for Keynesian effects of consolidation on demand. Effects on public budgets from population ageing and continued upward pressures on health spending are not explicitly included, or, put differently, they are implicitly assumed to be alleviated through reforms of relevant spending programmes or offset by other budgetary measures.</p>

Total saving in OECD countries is determined as the sum of public and private saving, although there is a 40% offset of any improvement in public saving from reduced private saving due to partial Ricardian equivalence (in line with OECD estimates, for example RÃ¶hn, 2011). </p>

For these countries, no individual projections of current balances are made. Rather, the combined current account balance of all non-OECD oil exporting countries is calculated based on projections of their balance of trade in oil, assuming some continuation of the upward pressure on oil prices on which the short-term projections are based, mitigated over the medium-term by an assumed supply response. </p>

Over a time horizon covering several decades, these structural conditions and policies are likely to evolve, and so the baseline scenario incorporates a number of policy developments seen as probable in several areas (i.e. it is deliberately not a baseline assuming <shortcitation>unchanged policies</shortcitation>).

The extent of these losses is uncertain, because of the inherent uncertainty surrounding estimates of potential output, the difficulty of knowing what the counter-factual would be and because of the difficulties of disentangling the effect of the crisis from other effects, including policy changes. Estimates of the impact of the crisis are derived from a comparison of the baseline potential output per capita to a counter-factual scenario in which: the trend participation and structural unemployment rates remain at their pre-crisis (2007) level; trend labour productivity is assumed to grow at the average rate observed in the pre-crisis period (2000-07); and demography remains the same as in the baseline. This method suggests a reduction in aggregate OECD-wide potential output of about 3Â¼ per cent in 2014 (see figure).</p>

              <p id="ID-42-1017826" indent="y" numbering="n">There is, however, wide variation in the estimated effect of the crisis on individual countries. The estimated effect on the median OECD country is over 4% in 2014, reflecting that smaller countries have typically been hit harder than larger ones. Indeed, the worst affected countries (those in the lower quartile) will have lost about 11% of potential by 2016. Conversely, for the least affected countries (upper quartile), the effect of the crisis gradually dissipates.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1017831" indent="y" numbering="n">The estimated impact of the crisis on individual OECD countries is heterogeneous and, especially for those most severely affected, is mostly explained by the loss of productivity growth (see second figure below). For the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland and Slovenia, the estimated negative impact of the crisis is above 10%, mostly reflecting lower trend productivity. The largest rise in the structural unemployment rate occurs in Spain, but the effect is partly counterbalanced by higher trend productivity, likely the consequence of a shift of production away from construction. </p>
              <p id="ID-42-1017836" indent="y" numbering="n">Conversely, for Israel, Turkey, Germany and Australia, the estimates of current potential output exceed the counter-factual mainly due to higher participation or lower structural unemployment than suggested by the immediate pre-crisis period. These latter results may be the consequence of previous labour market reforms (especially Germany) or the continuation of social trends in participation (especially rising female participation in Turkey and Israel) largely unaffected by the crisis, and illustrate the difficulties of constructing a reliable counter-factual. </p>
              <p id="ID-42-1017841" indent="y" numbering="n">The negative effect on participation is estimated to be greatest in Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Slovenia and the United States for which, judged relative to the immediate pre-crisis period, it could have subtracted between 3 to 4% from potential output. On the other hand, much of this fall may be explained by demographic trends; holding <emphasis emph="italic">age-specific</emphasis> participation rates at their pre-crisis levels would explain most (for Denmark, Japan and the United States) or more than half (Iceland and Slovenia) of the <emphasis emph="italic">aggregate</emphasis> fall in participation. If the adverse effect on labour force participation is ignored, then the estimate of the effect of the crisis on potential output in 2014 falls: from 5 to 2Â½ per cent for the United States; from 2Â¾ to Â¾ per cent for Japan; and from 3Â¼ to 2Â¼ per cent for the aggregate OECD.</p>

A major PPP revision for OECD countries (plus Russia) that updates the benchmark year from 2005 to 2011 was released earlier this year by the International Comparison Program (and is incorporated in the projections reported here), but the update for the rest of the world has only just been released (and so is not incorporated here). The latter update, incorporating methodological changes to the computations, results in a major upward revision in the relative size of emerging market economies. Notably, the PPP revision for China implies that GDP in 2011 was 18% larger than previously thought, which, scaling up GDP in following years commensurately, implies that Chinaâs GDP would surpass that of the United States this year rather than in the early 2020s as implied by the projections documented in this chapter. Similar revisions are expected for other BRIICS countries, implying a 23% increase in their combined GDP measured in PPPs in 2010.</p>

          <p id="ID5f704f86-71ed-45e4-a5af-a8a9d2985d38" indent="y" numbering="n">These growth patterns imply a massive shift in the composition of global output towards the non-OECD. Based on comparisons at current PPPs (see <xref refid="ID2827f422-4c80-4b75-8e52-2f854d92c84e" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>), the combined GDP of China and India was 33% of that of the OECD in 2010, but is expected to rise to 73% by 2060 (<xref refid="ID77aaefca-e416-41a9-8b72-8d62fd361afb" object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref"/>). Moreover as previously emphasised, recent PPP revisions (not incorporated here) exacerbate the shift to the emerging economies. At the same time, there will be a shift in the share of world GDP accounted for by Asia, at the expense of both North America and Europe. Having accounted for about one-quarter of global GDP at the beginning of the century, Asiaâs share has already risen to over one-third and is expected to reach 40% by 2030 and stabilise at around 45% in the 2050s. This is reflected in the ranking of the top five countries by GDP at the end of the projection: China, United States, India, Japan and Indonesia.</p>

              <p id="ID48960e63-740b-4f52-974a-2ef7c8c2ed08" indent="y" numbering="n">Comparisons of income across countries that do not share the same currency are usually made using purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than market exchange rates. PPPs denote the exchange rates that give purchasing power equivalence; so that one dollar purchases the same quantity of goods and services in all countries. Notwithstanding the major impending PPP revision for non-OECD countries previously referred to (which stems from methodological computational changes), PPP exchange rates will typically evolve slowly over time, as the purchasing power of incomes across countries evolves, and are subject to less volatility than market exchange rates. Since the prices of locally produced goods and services which are not subject to competition from imports are generally lower in a country with lower income, a PPP-based measure of income will typically show incomes in less developed economies to be higher than with a market exchange rate-based measure.</p>
              <p id="ID3223190e-6acb-42c4-af77-133b4778d928" indent="y" numbering="n">The Balassa-Samuelson effect suggests that as incomes converge, PPPs will converge on market exchange rates so that the difference between using market exchange rates and current PPPs to compare OECD and non-OECD economies will diminish over time. The Balassa-Samuelson effect arises because the growth of productivity differs among sectors, while wages tend to be less differentiated. Typically, productivity growth is faster in the traded goods sector than in the non-traded goods sector. To the extent that the faster productivity growth in the traded goods sector pushes up wages in all sectors, the prices of non-traded goods relative to those of traded goods will rise, thus leading to a rise in the overall price index. The speed at which the PPP exchange rate changes in response to convergence in income per capita is given by the empirical results of Frankel (2006).</p>
              <p id="ID04ff225b-0f0c-4103-80af-f88fe8c517f1" indent="y" numbering="n">Since incomes per head are typically lower in non-OECD countries compared to OECD countries, and so the price of non-traded goods and services cheaper, the relative size of non-OECD economies vis-Ã -vis the OECD economies is typically greater when measured on a current PPP basis than at current market exchange rates. This effect was observed long-ago in international comparisons using the Penn World Tables and has become known as the Penn Effect. Its evolution over time is seen in <xref refid="ID77aaefca-e416-41a9-8b72-8d62fd361afb" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/> where the global shares measured in current PPP get relatively closer to those measured with market exchange rates as income per capita converges.

Growth in aggregate OECD GDP per capita is projected to recover from the weakness experienced since the crisis, to be marginally higher over the period to 2060 than the 1Â½ per cent per annum experienced over 2000-07. Growth in non-OECD GDP per capita, which was seemingly little affected by the crisis, is much higher but projected to decline to 4% per annum to 2030 and 3% per annum over 2030-60.</p>

              <p id="IDb9afd6e0-4da7-42fe-8789-c3cb5342eca3" indent="y" numbering="n">This box highlights those countries for which improvements in GDP per capita are most striking, either in absolute terms or in their relative position as regards country rankings. Cross-country comparisons of levels of GDP per capita are made in terms of current purchasing power parities (PPPs). Using current PPP rather than fixed PPP means that the GDP of low-income countries like India and China rises somewhat less over the projection, relative to high-income countries such as the United States. In interpreting the rankings the limited country coverage should be borne in mind, as well as statistical issues relating to recent revisions to PPPs and national accounts for some countries (as discussed earlier in the main text). In particular, in relation to the table in this box, the recent revisions to PPPâs would raise historical GDP per capita in the BRIICs by an average of 5Â percentage points relative to that of the United States.</p>
              <p id="ID0b986ad8-3b23-4e85-ad3b-6f56784fa898" indent="y" numbering="n">Given the underlying framework of conditional convergence, absolute gains are larger for those countries which initially have the lowest GDP per capita. Thus, the average gain in GDP per capita to 2060, measured relative to the United States, is less than one percentage point for the countries currently ranked in the top ten, but averages 15 percentage points for the countries currently ranked in the bottom ten (see box table). However, the underlying conditional convergence assumption also suggests that changes in country rankings are likely to be understated; as illustrated by comparing changes in rankings over the historical period 1995-2012, which in absolute average terms are about 50% greater than over either of the projection periods 2012-30 or 2030-60. Or put another way, the model will not readily predict a repeat of historical episodes such as Japanâs <shortcitation>lost decade</shortcitation>, the effect of the financial crisis on Iceland or Irelandâs <shortcitation>Celtic Tiger</shortcitation> transformation.</p>
              <p id="ID6ce04f8d-cf54-454d-9561-e8ce526b8589" indent="y" numbering="n">Countries starting with similar levels of GDP per capita can, nevertheless, experience different degrees of projected catch-up (and so change rankings) for a variety of reasons, including momentum from initial labour efficiency growth and because changes in GDP per capita also arise because of changes in the employment rate, capital intensity or human capital. Differences in employment rate projections are in turn influenced by demographics as well as by assumptions about labour market policies, including those relating to retirement.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1021670" indent="y" numbering="n">Korea is among the countries which gain most in terms of GDP per capita ranking over the period 2012-30, due to momentum from recent rapid labour efficiency growth which carries over into the medium term as well as a strong contribution from human capital. (Korea is also one of the countries which has been boosted most by the recent SNA08 revision; the level of GDP was increased by about 8% and estimates of recent historical potential growth by about Â¼ percentage point per annum.) Otherwise, China gains most in terms of the absolute catch-up in GDP per capita (against the United States), which is a consequence of momentum from historically rapid labour efficiency growth as well as a further increase in capital intensity. While labour efficiency growth for China is projected to decline relative to its average growth rate over the last decade, over the period to 2030 it will still be faster than for any other country and about three times the average growth rate of the technology frontier.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1021675" indent="y" numbering="n">Among the countries which lose most in terms of GDP per capita ranking over the period 2012-30 are Italy, Portugal and Slovenia due to the inertia from a prolonged period of historically low labour efficiency growth compounded, in the cases of Portugal and Slovenia, by a decline in capital intensity which is a legacy of higher capital costs incurred during the euro area crisis.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1021680" indent="y" numbering="n">Countries which gain most in terms of GDP per capita ranking over the period 2030-60 include Chile, Portugal and Slovenia. This is mostly due to faster labour efficiency growth (boosted in the case of Portugal by stronger catch-up in human capital) and a more favourable development of the employment rate relative to their immediate peers, due to less pronounced ageing. Conversely, among the countries which lose most in terms of GDP per capita ranking over the period 2030-60 are Greece and the Slovak Republic (mainly because of unfavourable demographics) and Ireland (where labour efficiency levels are initially very high compared to most other countries).</p>

For the aggregate OECD, labour efficiency is projected to grow at 1.4 and 1.3 % per annum over the periods to 2030 and 2030-60, respectively, which is slightly above and close to the assumed rate of growth of the technology frontier. However, most non-OECD countries and a number of OECD countries (Chile, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Korea, Poland and the Slovak Republic) have faster projected growth in trend labour efficiency, reflecting a combination of rapid historical growth and the still great distance to the frontier (all of these countries currently have GDP per capita below the OECD median). Conversely, a number of other OECD countries â including Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Portugal and Spain â have much slower projected growth in trend labour efficiency, which reflects inertia from low historical growth that is mostly not just confined to the postâcrisis period. </p>

China is projected to experience a halving in labour efficiency growth to 2030 compared to the staggering 7-8% per annum growth rate it experienced since 2000, but this will still be faster than for any other country and three times the growth rate of the frontier. Labour efficiency growth for Indonesia and India is expected to be more stable at more than double the growth rate of the frontier over the entire period to 2060. In comparison, the growth rates of labour efficiency for other non-OECD countries, while eventually picking up to growth rates above that of the frontier, are less impressive, reflecting a weaker historical performance.</p>

However, for euro area countries (Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain), which have been most severely affected by the crisis, the projected decline in capital intensity reduces potential growth over the period to 2030 by between 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points per annum. Conversely, rising capital intensity (implying some continuation of recent trends) contributes to stronger productivity growth in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India and Russia to 2030 by between 0.3 to 0.7Â percentage points per annum. Beyond 2030, rising global interest rates (discussed in a later section) reduce capital intensity in all countries, typically subtracting 0.1Â percentage points from annual trend productivity growth.</p>

This is not only because it would take longer for those countries which start furthest from the productivity frontier, but also because differences in structural policies and other structural factors matter and can prevent complete catch-up. In the present modelling framework, important differences in underlying productivity levels are attributed to differences in structural policy settings as represented by the degree of competition-friendly product market regulation. Furthermore, differences in GDP per capita will persist because of differences in labour utilisation due to different structural characteristics of the labour market, including structural policy settings, as well as demographic differences.</p>

This demographic effect is, on average across all OECD countries, offset by rising labour force participation mainly due to a continuation of rising participation rates for women and older workers (<xref refid="ID9efeebba-c540-44ab-80ec-a7d8fbdcfe92" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).

Exceptions to the OECD-aggregate trend, where changes in labour utilisation make a more pronounced positive contribution to GDP per capita growth, are Chile, Israel, Mexico and Turkey, for which there is a rise in the share of the population of working-age to total population and for which participation rates are rising more strongly, especially boosted by strongly increasing female participation. Conversely, countries where there is a significant decline in labour utilisation include Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia.</p>

The gap between gross and net debt is particularly large for Norway, Japan, Sweden, Finland and Canada so that for these countries a gross debt target of 60% may appear unduly stringent. Gross debt is, however, preferable when looking at the immediate borrowing needs of governments and has the practical advantage of being more cross-country comparable because data on financial assets are of unequal quality across countries.</p></fnote> although differences in the treatment of public pension liabilities mean that not even gross measures of government debt are fully comparable (<xref refid="IDd26b2af8-36b9-4aad-91e9-2cddbe80873e" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).

              <p id="IDcaad806c-5381-4b82-bd35-d9893d28b5c5" indent="y" numbering="n">In the last decade, many OECD countries have passed pension reforms aimed at increasing the financial sustainability of their public pension systems or to adjust pension parameters to improvements in life expectancy. As a result, in a clear majority of countries the retirement age that earns entitlement to full pension benefits will increase over future decades.</p>
              <p id="ID92c0e39b-c3c4-4c37-969a-41c39ec8b62d" indent="y" numbering="n">The estimates presented here take account of the pension reforms legislated until January 2014. An unweighted OECD average of the statutory age at which a full pension becomes eligible (hereafter referred to as the <shortcitation>pensionable age</shortcitation>) is expected to rise from just under 64 years for men and 62Â½ for women in 2012, to just over 65 for men and just under 65 for women in 2030. In most OECD countries, a pensionable age of 65 applies already, especially for men. However, for a large number of OECD countries, a common trend will be to move towards 67 years or over. Today only Norway and Iceland have retirement ages set at 67 for both sexes, but in 2050 about 18 OECD countries will have reached or surpassed that retirement age.</p>
              <p id="ID92d90c48-ea34-4f71-a161-b4794bc37ace" indent="y" numbering="n">The increase in retirement age will follow country-specific pathways (see table below). In Canada and Germany, for instance, the transition from 65 years to 67 will be gradual and completed by around 2030. Conversely, in Australia, Poland and the United States the adjustment will be accomplished by the first half of the 2020s. Ireland and the United Kingdom have legislated increases in the pensionable age up to 68, to be reached by 2028 and 2048, respectively.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1027894" indent="y" numbering="n">Some major economies have linked the future evolution of their statutory retirement ages to trends in life expectancy (Italy, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark). The Czech Republic has implemented a quasi-indexed system by increasing the pension age for men by two months per birth cohort, without any upper limit. In 2044, the pension age of women will catch up to that for men, after which a single retirement age will apply for all.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1027899" indent="y" numbering="n">An important component of many recent reforms is the move towards gender parity in retirement conditions. While 14 OECD countries had different retirement ages across gender in 2012, by 2030 this number will be halved and by 2050 only Israel, Chile and Switzerland are expected to have different retirement ages between men and women.</p>

              </heading>
              <p id="ID2d0e5816-be59-4c0e-8d3c-f48c41c55bc7" indent="y" numbering="n">Differences in the institutional set-up and the recording of government sponsored pension schemes can have a substantial impact on reported levels of government debt. Using a recent survey of pension plan assets and liabilities, this box shows the impact of these differences and how they would affect the measure of gross debt which is regularly published in the <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> (column 3 in the table below).</p>
              <p id="IDfff855bd-2cc7-4c1a-b0ce-e5e75edead0f" indent="y" numbering="n">The way in which pension systems are organised varies significantly across countries. In some cases, pensions are based on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system, pension benefits being paid from current contributions. In other cases, (partially) funded systems are in place, in which contributions are accumulated and invested, and from which future benefits will (partially) be paid. Ideally, all pension liabilities, whether funded or unfunded, would be recorded. However, such estimates, especially those affecting government debt levels, will only become available for all EU countries in the course of 2017. For some non-EU OECD countries it may take even longer. </p>
              <p id="ID5b523ccd-af2b-4f98-b145-0324234aa15f" indent="y" numbering="n">Currently, the organisation and the recording of pension systems in national accounts have a direct impact on the comparability of reported government debt measures. This is especially true of the way in which governments have organised pension systems for civil servants. Generally, pension liabilities of unfunded PAYG-systems are not counted as part of government debt. On the other hand, liabilities of (partially) funded schemes are usually counted, but not necessarily as part of government debt. If the relevant pension funds are operating autonomously, their assets and liabilities are recorded as part of the financial corporationsâ sector and, therefore, do not impact government debt. However, if the pension funds are underfunded, countries have some flexibility in the recording of the unfunded part of the liabilities. Sometimes these are not recorded as a debt of the sponsor, in this case the government, and thus do not feature as part of government debt.</p>
              <p id="IDdabce093-4952-4364-918d-8fcde4f9aa45" indent="y" numbering="n">One option for international comparisons is to use total liabilities of general government according to the System of National Accounts (first column of the table below). This measure includes, in some countries, unfunded liabilities associated with partially funded government employee pension plans (second column). Because countries that include such liabilities in their government accounts appear to have inflated public debt levels relative to countries that do not or that have PAYG systems, the <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> reports only adjusted figures that leave out these liabilities from government gross debt statistics (column 3). The adjustment has a considerable impact in some countries, lowering public debt estimates for Australia, Canada, Iceland and the United States by some 15-25% of GDP.</p>
              <p id="ID5a9c887a-94c5-4b15-bcef-a698d71f0afb" indent="y" numbering="n">But even after this adjustment, countries with (partially) funded government employee pension plans, classified in either the government sector or the financial corporationsâ sector, are arguably still somewhat disadvantaged in international comparisons, because accumulated assets in the relevant pension schemes (the funded part) are partly the product of previous government expenditures that in the past gave rise to higher government deficits, and consequently higher debt levels, all else equal. Such assets may have been accumulated inside the general government sector, as in the case of Australia, Japan and Portugal (column 4), or outside of it (column 5). Taking into account assets accumulated for the payment of future pension benefits can have a significant impact on international rankings of government indebtedness (column 6). Canada and the Netherlands have funds amounting to more than 40% of GDP, whereas Iceland, Switzerland and the United States have accumulated assets worth around 30% of GDP.</p>
              <p id="ID3a5cfeba-0919-4888-9030-e9818ce86aea" indent="y" numbering="n">In addition to pension plans for civil servants, governments also operate more generic, social security type schemes for the population at large. These may provide a minimum pension benefit for the whole population, or they may relate to more extended arrangements. Presently, no country records the corresponding pension liabilities as part of government debt, although some have made estimates in view of the mandatory requirement in the EU to provide this information in 2017. A few countries have established dedicated funds for these future pension benefits (columnÂ 7). In Sweden, these funds amount to more than 25% of GDP. Less significant funds, worth between 5% and 11% of GDP, exist in Canada, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Beyond dedicated funds for the payment of future pension benefits within the general government, the amount of financial assets accumulated by governments more generally, also differs across countries. For example, social security funds in Finland have accumulated substantial assets equal to about 78 percentage points of GDP.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1035487" indent="y" numbering="n">The above analysis shows that, depending on the treatment of pension systems, gross government liabilities can vary by as much as 70 percentage points of GDP (comparing columns 1 and 8 in the case of Canada), with variations of 40â50 percentage points for Iceland, Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. These findings call for care and transparency when presenting government debt figures, and especially when making comparisons between countries.</p>

In the remaining OECD countries, there is a range of further consolidation requirements beyond 2013. Some of that required change includes commitments made by governments to improve budget positions byÂ 2015, which are incorporated in the short-term projections described in previous chapters. The remainder is measured here as the <emphasis emph="italic">average</emphasis> projected underlying primary balance after 2015 that is required to stabilise debt at 60% of GDP (<xref refid="IDd1d39f6d-206d-43c0-be10-d71e71a318d6" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).<fnote id="ID-42-1009033"><p id="IDda81c1b7-ad96-4ff1-aa7e-1d35f9d505fd" indent="y" numbering="n">The measure of average consolidation is taken as the difference between the underlying primary balance in the initial year (here 2015) and the average of the underlying primary balance in each year up to 2030, except for those countries where the debt target is reached after 2030 for which the average is taken to the year in which government debt reaches the 60% target.</p></fnote> The average consolidation requirement is a robust measure of consolidation needs as it is little affected by the timing of consolidation (see Box 4.5 of OECD (2013a)) and is conceptually similar to, and empirically closely correlated with, measures of the so-called <shortcitation>fiscal gap</shortcitation>, which measures the immediate increase in the underlying primary balance, which if sustained, will ensure a particular debt target is reached in a particular year. </p>

Firstly, because the required profile of the underlying primary balance is likely to involve an intermediate <emphasis emph="italic">peak</emphasis> increase which is greater than the <emphasis emph="italic">average</emphasis> increase referred to above (see Box 4.5 in OECD (2013a)). This is because of the need to put debt on a declining path towards the target. Once on that path, declining debt interest payments allow for some relaxation of effort while achieving a gradual convergence to the target. Among the countries that require most consolidation (but excluding Japan), the peak measure in these projections is typically 2-3 percentage points of GDP higher than the average measure of consolidation.<fnote id="ID-42-1009062"><p id="IDf46bc406-7634-4167-a946-3b1ee3964bfd" indent="y" numbering="n">The peak measure is, however, more dependent on the particular fiscal adjustment profile used to achieve the debt target, of which the baseline represents one specific case.</p></fnote></p>

          <p id="IDb616d26d-87cc-4df3-b2e2-316a4d8c91e9" indent="y" numbering="n"> Real long-term interest rates for the median OECD country are projected to rise by about 1Â¾ percentage points over the next 4-5 years as output gaps close and policy rates normalise (<xref refid="IDd1d39f6d-206d-43c0-be10-d71e71a318d6" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). Lower government indebtedness is projected to dampen the rise in interest rates through a number of channels at least until 2030. Firstly, lower government indebtedness reduces fiscal risk premia, as the number of OECD countries with government debt levels above the threshold of 75% of GDP, at which fiscal risk premia are assumed to be incurred, falls from 17 now, to 13 by 2020 and only one (Japan) by 2030 (<xref refid="IDaae56d59-0c4d-490e-aef8-461da4aa6a69" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). Among these countries, consolidation is projected to reduce the fiscal risk premium on average by about 1 percentage point to 2030. Secondly, to the extent that higher public debt is often associated with higher external debt and lower government debt reduces net external debt, it will also reduce country-specific risk premia on domestic interest rates; the (unweighted) average risk premium associated with net external debt among all OECD countries is projected to halve by 2030 from its current estimated level of Â¾ of a percentage point now. Nevertheless, OECD countries which are still expected to incur risk premia associated with external debt of more than one percentage point in 2030 include Iceland, Greece and New Zealand.</p>

However, a dominant influence tending to reduce national saving in both OECD and non-OECD countries will be population ageing, which in the case of non-OECD countries will be re-enforced by increased access to credit and the wider provision of social safety nets. Nevertheless, despite saving rates falling in nearly all countries, the global saving rate remains relatively stable to 2030 because of a compositional effect as the share of high-saving countries (especially China and India) in global output rises (<xref refid="ID0c2c78c8-ca73-4360-b58b-800f90d5c965" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).

Reducing government debt to 60% of GDP would, for the 10 OECD countries for which government debt is currently highest, lower combined fiscal and net external debt risk premia by an average of 1Â½ percentage points, reduce government debt service by an average of 4 percentage points of GDP and boost medium-term growth by 0.2 percentage points per year (all by 2030, relative to a counter-factual in which current debt levels are maintained). This boost to GDP ignores the Keynesian effects that further consolidation might have in delaying the closure of output gaps with possible detrimental hysteresis effects on potential output (De Long and Summers, 2012), although the pace of further consolidation is assumed to be modest (a maximum of Â½ per cent of GDP per annum).</p>

Structural reforms, particularly if they boost employment, can also ease fiscal constraints. While some structural reform is built into the current projection baseline, there remains ample scope for further enhancement as illustrated in a range of scenarios considered here: firstly, raising potential employment, either by reducing structural unemployment or promoting female labour force participation; secondly, improving product market regulation to facilitate competition and so boost productivity; and finally to promote human capital by better access to quality education.</p>

In the baseline projection, structural unemployment is slowly converging to the level observed before the crisis in each country.</p></fnote> Higher potential employment increases tax revenue and reduces unemployment-related welfare benefits. Furthermore, if the additional employment is in the private sector, implying a rise in the tax base relative to expenditure on public sector wages, then total government expenditure will fall as a share of GDP.<fnote id="ID-42-1009321"><p id="IDd6d878e0-364a-44b1-989a-508ae1f72a63" indent="y" numbering="n">Structural reforms are more likely to positively affect fiscal balances if they generate higher potential employment rather than result in higher trend productivity. The total estimated improvement in the underlying primary balance from an increase in potential employment by 1 percentage point ranges from between 0.3 and 0.8 per cent of GDP, with the effect largest in countries where the initial ratio of public to private sector employment and the initial proportion of primary public expenditure to GDP are highest (OECD, 2010).</p></fnote> On this basis, the scope for the largest falls in structural unemployment relative to the baseline projection are for Spain (down by 10 percentage points), Greece (7Â½ percentage points), the Slovak Republic (9 percentage points) and Portugal (4 percentage points). The biggest permanent improvements in the primary balance are for these countries as well as others, such as France or Belgium, for which the fall in structural
unemployment may be less, but unemployment-related benefits are relatively high and public sector employment is a relatively high share of total employment (<xref refid="ID43907402-2849-47a1-929b-802319a464d4" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). For these six countries, the reduction in structural unemployment would permanently improve the primary balance by more than 2 percentage points of GDP and for Spain the improvement would be more than double that. To put the magnitude of these effects in context, the pressures from increased public spending on health and pensions are expected to amount to just under 3 percentage points of GDP for the median OECD country to 2030. As well as reducing the extent of required consolidation to achieve any given debt target, falling structural unemployment would also enable that target to be achieved earlier;<fnote id="ID-42-1009379"><p id="ID6134711e-cf15-4ed9-af01-652180628972" indent="y" numbering="n">Fiscal consolidation in the baseline takes place through a gradual improvement in the underlying primary balance with a maximum cap on consolidation in any single year of Â½ percentage point of GDP, but the effect from the reduction in unemployment is assumed to come in addition to the cap as the improvement is an indirect effect of labour market reforms.</p></fnote> the 60% debt target in the baseline would be reached 5 years earlier for the Slovak Republic, 4 years earlier for Greece and 3 years earlier for France and Portugal.</p>

While social trends have played a key role in the rise in female participation, policies can also have an impact (ThÃ©venon, 2013). This is particularly true as regards the availability of reliable and affordable day-care, which significantly increases the ability of either spouse to remain in the workforce after child-birth â but most often impacts on women. A related issue is whether parental leave that can be taken by either parent. Other policies that have significant impacts on female participation include facilitating part-time employment, which at present is still subject to significant penalties relative to full-time employment in most countries (OECD,Â 2010), including lack of basic levels of job security, training and promotion, less access to unemployment benefits or re-employment assistance. </p>

In the empirical work underlying the current modelling framework (JohanssonÂ <emphasis emph="italic">etÂ al</emphasis>.,Â 2013) more pro-competition product market regulation, as quantified by the OECDâs product market regulation index, was found to boost long-term productivity and thus affect the pace at which countries converge towards the international technological frontier.</p></fnote> In the baseline scenario, a gradual improvement in product market regulations (as quantified by the PMR index) is assumed so that all countries improve to at least the current average across OECD countries at a speed which is consistent with the average rate of improvement observed over recent history. This speed of improvement has slowed over the past 5 years, although there are some exceptions â notably Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal and the Slovak Republic â where there have been more substantial reforms (OECD, 2014b). In a variant scenario, designed to reflect a faster pace of reform, the rate of improvement in product market regulations in all countries is set equal to the average pace of this fast-reforming group of countries.
The faster speed of product market reform boosts trend productivity most in those countries where there is greatest scope to catch-up in terms of competition-enhancing regulation (and not at all for those countries for which the PMR indicator is already better than the current OECD average). Thus, gains are typically larger for non-OECD economies, with GDP increasing by an average of 9% by 2030, and for the six OECD countries in which regulations are currently most stringent, where GDP is boosted by an average of 6% by 2030 (<xref refid="IDee2b66cc-603c-447b-b17e-c3e447926764" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>). In a further scenario, in which the level of product market regulation is also assumed to improve to at least the best quartile currently observed among OECD countries, rather than just the current OECD average (as in the baseline and first scenario), the GDP gains would be even larger and spread among a much wider group of countries. Such a reform effort would also come close to meeting the G20âs target to raise collective GDP by 2% within 5 years.</p>

Education increases human capital and so makes workers more productive and has been among the most important drivers for increasing long-run living standards (Cohen and Soto, 2007; Bouis <emphasis emph="italic">et al</emphasis>, 2011). There is likely to be a larger benefit to reforms where average years of schooling are initially low, as empirical evidence suggests that the returns from boosting coverage and performance in primary and secondary education are greater than for tertiary education.<fnote id="ID-42-1009552"><p id="ID0f387138-2a46-4869-bff4-3779ba37b38b" indent="y" numbering="n">This is reflected in the current modelling framework whereby human capital improvement is modelled as a decreasing function of additional years of schooling</p></fnote> In order to simulate the effect of ambitious education reforms in emerging economies, a variant scenario with faster improvement in educational attainment was constructed based on historical episodes in low-income countries in which major reforms enhanced primary and secondary coverage and performance. Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, and Russia all experienced periods of a decade or more in which there was above average growth in educational attainment of the 25 to 29 year-old group. During these episodes, the annual speed of convergence in educational levels was on average around 60% higher than assumed in the baseline. Applying a similar rate of improvement, the variant scenario highlights the long-term gains in productivity that faster improvements in educational attainment can bring in emerging economies. There are likely to be long lags before there are major GDP effects because the primary beneficiaries will be those who are currently
young, but over the long-term (to 2060) the GDP gains could be around 10% or more for China, India, Indonesia and South Africa (<xref refid="ID6598d3be-5bb2-4261-b942-5e74b104fd13" object="table" type="sing" cont="none" format="xref"/>).<fnote id="ID-42-1009617"><p id="ID3fc6ed58-0545-4035-aa2c-54582b28c6c7" indent="y" numbering="n">The Turkish government recently approved a reform programme aimed at increasing the average schooling attainment of the cohort age 25 to 29 to about 13 years by 2025, which is not incorporated in the baseline projection reported here, but the possible effects on GDP are considered in OECD (2012).</p></fnote></p>

      <p id="d1e171" indent="y" numbering="n">This annex contains data on key economic series which provide a background to the recent economic developments in the OECD area described in the main body of this report. Data for 2014 to 2015 are OECD estimates and projections. The data in some of the tables have been adjusted to conform to internationally agreed concepts and definitions in order to make them more comparable across countries, as well as consistent with historical data shown in other OECD publications. Regional aggregates are based on weights that change each period, with the weights depending on the series considered. For details on aggregation, see <emphasis emph="italic">OECD Economic Outlook</emphasis> Sources and Methods.</p>
      <p id="d1e172" indent="y" numbering="n">The OECD projection methods and underlying statistical concepts and sources are described in detail in <emphasis emph="italic">OECD Economic Outlook</emphasis> Sources and Methods (<hyperlink url="http://www.oecd.org/eco/sources-and-methods.htm" target="webpage">www.oecd.org/eco/sources-and-methods.htm</hyperlink>).</p>

      <p id="d1e174" indent="y" numbering="n">The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities.

          <p id="d1e1768" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD quarterly projections are on a seasonal and working-day-adjusted basis for selected key variables. This implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may occur, though these in general are quite small. In some countries, official forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD.</p>
