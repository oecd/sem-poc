					Economy: Investment is Key to Getting a Better Grade</mainhead>
      </heading>
      <p id="IDe8ceacba-82c1-42f9-b79a-cd3574cd55cf" instlang="en" indent="n" numbering="n">The economic recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that broke out
				in 2008 has been unusually weak. Global growth has consistently been slower than the
				average pace during the dozen or so years before the global financial crisis. The
				failure to achieve a stronger cyclical upswing has had very real costs in terms of
				foregone employment, stagnant living standards in advanced economies, less vigorous
				development in some emerging economies, and rising inequality nearly everywhere. </p>
      <p id="ID65d504fa-4297-4e45-9c8d-6668243391eb" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In
				this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> we project that global
				growth will strengthen gradually to approach its past average pace by late 2016.
				Growth is expected to be shared more evenly across regions of the world, with
				external imbalances generally smaller than they were in the run-up to the global
				crisis. Labour markets are gradually healing in the advanced economies. Risks of
				deflation have receded. Yet, we give the global economy only the barely passing
				grade of B-. </p>
      <p id="ID9ac3cad8-b3d6-46f3-bed3-1b026930039f" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Why the dissatisfaction? To begin with, our starting point is inauspicious. The
				first quarter of 2015 saw the weakest global growth since the crisis. The United
				States experienced a particularly sharp dip, but a number of other advanced
				economies shrank during the quarter, and growth in China slowed down more than
				expected. We see this weakness at the beginning of the year as largely the result of
				temporary factors. The boost to consumption from lower oil prices is still expected
				to come through in oil-importing countries, where demand will also be spurred by the
				widespread monetary easing (often accompanied by currency depreciation) in countries
				accounting for more than 50% of world GDP. A generally neutral fiscal stance in most
				large economies will not be a drag on growth, unlike in the previous few years. </p>
      <p id="ID3617b065-0a9b-4ccb-9ee9-cccb9b6b7784" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">But even if we are right about the transitory nature of the latest bout of weak
				growth, the outlook is not satisfactory. Despite tailwinds and policy actions, real
				investment has been tepid and productivity growth disappointing. By and large, firms
				have been unwilling to spend on plant, equipment, technology and services as
				vigorously as they have done in previous cyclical recoveries. Moreover, many
				governments postponed infrastructure investments as part of fiscal consolidation. </p>
      <p id="ID90e257e6-d9a0-4aff-9db6-3597b95f9d1f" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">This <emphasis emph="italic">Outlook</emphasis> takes a detailed look at
				investment, concluding that the slow rate of private investment is largely explained
				by subdued (actual and expected) demand, both at home and globally. This demand
				weakness has hindered investment growth, which in turn has held back employment,
				wages, and consumption. On the supply side, sluggish investment has undermined the
				rate of growth of potential output – the capacity of economies to increase living
				standards, make good on future obligations to citizens, and repay debt – via a
				slower rate of increase of the capital stock and a slowdown in the diffusion and
				embodiment of technical change. The world economy remains stuck in a low-level
				supply-demand equilibrium environment. </p>
      <p id="IDd8235afe-1c2a-4d26-a7f9-91b2123858ba" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Boosting the performance of the global economy requires jumping to a higher growth
				equilibrium with more investment, that creates more employment, jobs, and
				consumption demand, which ratifies the higher rate of investment, leading to the
				beneficial supply-side outcome. At least some of what we see as needed for such a
				jump to a high-level equilibrium is in prospect, given macro-policies and global
				demand balance. In our projections, fixed investment growth in the OECD region picks
				up to 4% next year, the highest rate since the crisis. But whether investment
				accelerates in line with our projections is a key question hanging over the
				improving outlook that we depict. Moreover, even if it does, this would still be
				insufficient to deliver the strong global growth in the near term needed to increase
				employment and reduce inequality; potential output growth would still look anaemic
				compared to past decades.</p>
      <p id="ID0b7c44bd-57a7-463a-b23e-5cf7635e7351" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">So, more than demand-oriented macro policies are needed to generate a strong and
				durable boost to investment. Reducing policy uncertainty would help, such as a
				tone-down of fiscal brinksmanship in the United States, favourable resolution of
				Greece’s status <emphasis emph="italic">vis-à-vis</emphasis> the euro area,
				realistic medium-term fiscal path in Japan, and greater transparency of financial
				systems in emerging economies. Progress on reducing financing constraints in the
				euro area through attention to non-performing loans could cement more positive
				business sentiment there. Clear signals this year at COP21 on co-ordinated
				international action to combat climate change could be an important incentive to
				underpin a surge in investment, with benefits for demand, innovation and
				environmental sustainability.</p>
      <p id="ID3110ab13-45c2-4070-9c1b-66160cde54db" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Structural policies have a central role to play to achieve more satisfactory and
				sustained investment growth. Restrictive product market regulation impedes the
				growth of the capital stock in OECD economies. FDI restrictiveness (and corruption)
				affect quantity and quality of cross-border investment. In the European Union,
				attention to disparities and complexities in regulation of network services
				industries, as proposed in the Investment Plan for Europe, would support investment
				to complete the Single Market. In some emerging markets cost-benefit analysis would
				improve the returns to investment, making it a more sustainable underpinning for
				growth.</p>
      <p id="ID68e2ec62-b21f-4fed-97c3-517a69ec0941" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> calls on countries to adopt
				balanced policy packages with mutually reinforcing monetary, fiscal and structural
				policies. Collective action with positive spillovers can boost the global economy to
				the higher-growth equilibrium with stronger investment, more employment, and a
				greater capacity to improve living standards for all. More robust global growth will
				make countries and the global economy more resilient to salient risks such as
				financial instability. Expanding employment and strengthening public finances are
				pathways to equality of opportunity. The world economy is muddling through with a
				B-minus average, but if homework is not done and with less than average luck, a
				failing grade is all too possible. On the other hand, how to get the A is known and
				within reach. </p>

        <p id="ID054efaa7-2c9a-4166-95ba-5d5a62554d32" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Global growth is projected to strengthen in the course of 2015 and
					2016, but will remain modest relative to the pre-crisis period and its global
					distribution will change from that in recent years. The acceleration is
					underpinned by very supportive monetary conditions, a slower pace of fiscal
					consolidation, financial repair and lower oil prices. Investment, a crucial
					component to the outlook, has yet to take off. The appreciation of the US dollar
					against most currencies has led to a significant realignment in exchange rates
					since mid-2014. The ensuing relative price effects are shifting global demand
					more toward Europe, Japan and some emerging market economies (EMEs). Growth in
					EMEs is slowing due to specific factors in China, Brazil and Russia and it could
					continue to be weak in the absence of structural reforms to undo
					bottlenecks.</p>
        <p id="ID4eae168e-1cdd-45ea-ad6d-55278da6df24" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Ordinary risks to the recovery path are broadly balanced around
					the central projection but a few extraordinary negative event risks are not
					taken into account and could shift the global growth path substantially. The
					projected pick-up in investment could remain elusive, but on the other hand,
					investment could respond more strongly than anticipated to an upturn in
					spending, reduced uncertainties and recent structural reforms, particularly in
					the light of low financing costs, as discussed in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5b8949e0-1979-4e6e-bcfc-c02409915157"/>. Similarly, compensation
					could accelerate more than anticipated given the continued improvements of
					labour market conditions in most large OECD areas, which would support more
					consumption growth than projected. However, similar expectations have failed to
					materialise in the past, and this pattern could continue. Sustained quantitative
					easing in the euro area and Japan may prove less effective at stimulating demand
					than assumed. Weakness in the first quarter in the United States and in many
					EMEs may signal more underlying weakness than embedded in the projections. And
					oil price changes could either reduce some of the recent real income gains that
					are helping to boost global demand, or add to them. </p>
        <p id="ID3b6cb76f-9c2b-4b9a-9566-f36c88d339db" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The extraordinary risks include geopolitical upheavals and severe
					financial instability brought about by a disorderly exit from the zero interest
					rate policy in the United States, failure to reach a satisfactory agreement
					between Greece and its creditors, and a hard landing in China. Avoiding these
					risks and moving the global economy to a higher and more stable growth path
					require mutually reinforcing monetary, fiscal and structural policies.</p>

        <p id="ID71a0f0f8-05ca-4d90-8f5d-d9503ea4318c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Based on OECD assumptions (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5bcf636b-9673-4a12-9d1d-60449191f830"/>),
					growth in both OECD and non-OECD countries is projected to pick up through 2015,
					after a very weak start to the year (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID-BIHJDIBB001"/> and <xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID8d01722a-514d-4f40-bfd9-fd63615eef47"/>).
					In 2016 growth is projected to strengthen only slightly in the OECD area, but
					more so in the non-OECD area (<xref object="figure" type="plu" cont="no" format="xref plu s" refid="IDdfdbd2f5-f641-4780-96f0-9bc41d40232c"/>
					<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="and" format="xref and" refid="ID82878151-90d2-44ef-b61d-e7afcf05f569"/>). After turning slightly
					negative in early 2015, growth in the United States is projected to recover
					thanks to supportive, though gradually less accommodative, monetary conditions,
					the dissipation of fiscal drag, lower energy prices and an ongoing increase in
					household wealth. However, the pick-up will be tempered by the stronger dollar
					and falling investment in the energy sector. In the euro area and Japan activity
					will be supported by lower oil prices, currency depreciation and monetary policy
					stimulus. Fiscal adjustment is expected to be slower in Japan and pause in the
					euro area, which will also support growth. In  China growth is projected
					to edge down as the restructuring of the economy progresses, with services
					taking over from investment and real estate as the main driver of economic
					growth. In contrast, growth is set to pick up in the other main EMEs: the
					recessions in Russia and Brazil are projected to give way to low but positive
					growth in 2016; growth in India will remain broadly stable in 2015 and 2016; and
					Indonesia’s growth is projected to rise over the remainder of 2015 and in
					2016.</p>

										spreading to EMEs, with the oil intensity of China projected

										similar pace as the aggregate of non-OECD economies (2.4%

										capacity of the United Arab Emirates and Libya is also
										projected to grow (by about 2% p.a.) but other OPEC
										producers with higher costs, lower financial reserves, and
										social and budgetary pressures will see stagnation or even
										declines. Among non-OPEC countries, the United States will
										remain the top source of global supply growth in barrel
										terms. Supply is projected to grow around 3% p.a. in the

						early 2015, and the partial rebound in oil prices since March, this implies
						that headline inflation rates have already troughed. Indeed, monthly global
						consumer price inflation has picked up to 0.2-0.3% in recent months. The
						second-round effects, via wages or the use of oil as an input into the
						production of other goods and services, of the oil price drop appear to have
						been modest so far. Medium-term inflation expectations have either been
						little affected, particularly in the case of survey-based measures, or their

						income received a fillip from the collapse in oil and other commodity
						prices, which produced a large but temporary disinflationary impulse in the

						in the global CPI was zero. Consumer prices in advanced countries even saw
						outright declines in November and December 2014 and January 2015 (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID7d6dd6a2-44bf-40dd-93d6-433317185bc0"/>). Together with slowly
						improving labour markets, this negative price impulse inflated real wages
						and real disposable income. In the United States modest and stable average
						hourly wage growth of around 2% at the turn of the year still translated
						into an acceleration in real wages. By March 2015 real personal disposable
						income was up 3.3% from a year ago. The benefit to US consumers from lower
						energy prices is estimated to be equivalent to a tax cut in excess of USD
						500 per household, with the impact concentrated on lower-income households,
						who have a higher marginal propensity to consume. The purchasing power lift
						to euro area or Japanese households is more modest than in the United
						States, given euro and yen weakness and lower oil consumption intensity, but
						it is still significant.</p>

						purchasing power. A strong consumer response began to build in the last
						quarter of 2014, with global retail sales volumes jumping 6.6% at an

						the euro area (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID4aff9d6f-5aa2-4659-9294-5a8abd0e083e"/>). Strong consumer
						spending in the euro area was also supported by a surge in consumer
						confidence, lower bank lending rates for households and an easing in credit
						conditions. In the United States real consumer spending growth also
						accelerated strongly in the second half of 2014 to an annual rate above 4%.
						But while retail sales volumes in the euro area look set to post a similar
						3% annualised gain in the first quarter of 2015, globally they have
						decelerated sharply, with barely any growth estimated in the first quarter
						of 2015. In the United States real consumer spending grew only 1.8% on an
						annualised basis in the first quarter despite a 5.3% gain in real disposable
						income. Some of the early-year weakness in the United States can probably be
						attributed to bad weather effects rather than a permanently higher saving
						rate. Consumer spending should thus pick up in the coming months, supported
						by robust labour income, low interest rates, strong sentiment and the
						gradual pass-through of the stronger dollar into consumer prices. The
						early-year slowdown in consumer spending in other parts of the world
						represents more of a puzzle but is also expected to reverse following

						slower technical progress (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID03977de2-f65b-4b5a-9714-75c4318376cc"/>). Some of
						this recent weakness is cyclical and due to a sharp slowdown in tangible
						investment during the financial crisis. But the subsequent investment
						recovery has been sluggish compared with past recessions, although in line
						with the weakness in output according to accelerator-type models (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID04e4d3b9-440b-4a1b-8fa7-4db8df36354a"/>; <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5b8949e0-1979-4e6e-bcfc-c02409915157"/>; IMF, 2015a).

						the tepidness of investment is not a new trend. Except in countries like
						Canada and Australia, which ramped up mining sector investment in the 2000s

						projected to strengthen only mildly until end-2016 as compared with previous
						cyclical recoveries. This is consistent with the projected modest
						acceleration in domestic and global activity, lingering uncertainty, the
						remaining excess capacity in many areas and the drag on investment
						engendered by lower oil prices in some large economies like the United
						States and Canada. As economies continue to recover, consumption growth
						accelerates in line with wages and incomes, and confidence in future
						economic prospects strengthens, firms can be expected to increase the pace
						of investment spending. A number of OECD countries have also implemented
						sizeable structural reforms in the wake of the economic crisis. On average
						across the OECD, countries have made progress in abolishing price controls
						or improving their design, streamlining administrative procedures for
						start-ups, simplifying rules and procedures and improving access to
						information about regulations. As these reforms bear fruit, output and
						investment should accelerate. Moreover, the boost to investment and growth
						in one country spills over to support investment and growth in others. Hence
						revived growth prospects, particularly in the euro area and Japan, could
						disproportionately boost global growth relative to the last several years
						when these areas have lagged. Such a collective response could boost the
						current low-level growth equilibrium to a higher sustained growth
						equilibrium.</p>

							wage growth could pick up more than expected, driving acceleration in

							equities. In addition to direct holdings of bonds and equities,
							households can be exposed to financial markets through their savings
							with institutional investors such as pension funds. Households are also
							exposed to the financial system through bank deposit accounts and

							managed by institutions (such as pension funds) on household behaviour
							depends on the regulatory environment which may prohibit households from
							drawing down wealth prior to retirement. As richer households have a

							is concentrated, it is less so than household assets. In the United
							States almost three-quarters of households have some form of debt,
							compared with roughly half in France, Germany and the United Kingdom,
							and only a quarter in Italy. Therefore, for many households with debt
							the benefit of QE will only be through effects on the interest rate as
							their financial assets are limited to deposit accounts. This in turn
							will depend on how easily households can reduce interest rates on their
							bank loans – variable rate mortgages predominate in Italy and account

              <p id="ID-42-1139539" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Anchoring
								the public finances in the medium term to achieve a prudent and
								sustainable level of debt and net worth can be supported by
								well-designed fiscal rules (Fall et al., 2015). These can help to
								guide fiscal policy decisions and to commit governments to sound
								policies in the face of short-term pressures. Fiscal rules are
								especially important in a monetary union to ensure that budgetary
								policy plays the required counter-cyclical stabilisation role in the
								absence of other levers at national level, and because market
								creditworthiness may be fragile.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1139544" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The
								Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) of the EU Treaty provides the
								cornerstone of EU fiscal governance. A major overhaul of the euro
								area fiscal rules was undertaken in 2011-13 with the Six and Two
								Packs of regulations and laws and the new <shortcitation>Fiscal
									Compact</shortcitation> Treaty. These rules aim to avoid
								excessive fiscal imbalances and to provide a set of rules for the
								medium-term budget balance and the debt-to-GDP ratio.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1139559" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">While the
								application of the new rules is still in its infancy (European
								Commission, 2014), experience of applying the new framework in
								recent years points to a number of questions about whether the rules
								could be made more effective in anchoring policy in the medium term.
								There are three main areas where the EU rules currently raise
								concerns.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1139564" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">First, many
								countries are still to meet the 3% of GDP deficit ceiling of the
									<shortcitation>corrective arm</shortcitation> of the SGP.
								Deadlines have been extended on 12 occasions since 2009. This partly
								reflects the fact that a headline GDP ceiling during a cyclical
								downturn can lead to undesirable pro-cyclical policies. It has
								therefore been appropriate to allow some slippage. However, the
								uncertainty around whether such leeway would be granted and
								requirements imposed around it could create uncertainty about policy
								and risk undermining some of the beneficial effects on demand that
								can be achieved by allowing fiscal policy to offset negative
								economic shocks.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1139579" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Second, the
								medium-term objectives<emphasis emph="bolditalic"> </emphasis>(MTOs)
								for the structural budget balance in the <shortcitation>preventive
									arm</shortcitation> of the SGP point to some problems because of
								measurement issues that are inherent with cyclical adjustment in
								general and with the EU’s agreed methodology for estimating
								potential output and output gaps in particular. While the focus on
								structural budget balances should in principle provide a more stable
								medium-term anchor for fiscal policy, there are cases where the
								measurement problems may be leading to pro-cyclical and unstable
								policy requirements.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1139602" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">For
								example, European Commission estimates of potential output growth in
								Italy and Spain have been revised substantially over the past year
								(Figure). These effects are large enough to have policy-relevant
								implications for how much fiscal consolidation is required each year
								to meet the MTOs. A number of methodological changes, including
								options that countries can apply, have been introduced in the past

								expenditure benchmark can create anomalies that run counter to a
								medium-term policy orientation. For example, the debt rule
								potentially requires very large swings in the budget balance when it
								begins to bind, if a country’s budget balance and GDP growth start
								from a position far from what is needed to meet the frontloaded
								adjustments imposed on high-debt countries (Barnes et al., 2012).
								While the expenditure benchmark is intended to achieve the MTO, it
								uses a long average of potential output and this may lead to
								inconsistent signals to the MTO. Updating the benchmark on an annual
								basis and the translation from the real-terms measures in the
								expenditure benchmark to nominal quantities required for budgeting
								may make multi-annual budgeting more difficult.</p>

								the system). Widespread deviations are likely to undermine the
								effectiveness of the overall framework and political support for it.
								Hence, fiscal oversight should put greater emphasis on the
								medium-term outlook for <emphasis emph="italic">observable</emphasis> variables, including the budget balance
								and debt-to-GDP ratio, supported by sound macroeconomic forecasts
								and realistic budgetary projections. Less emphasis should be put on

						consolidation in the aftermath of the crisis relied to a considerable extent
						on cutting public investment (about one-quarter of the consolidation effort
						since 2010). This has been costly in terms of demand stabilisation as fiscal
						multipliers associated with government investment spending are higher than
						for other fiscal instruments (<xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5b8949e0-1979-4e6e-bcfc-c02409915157"/>).
						Empirical analysis also suggests that cuts in public spending on
						infrastructure can lower potential growth (e.g. Barbiero and Cournède,
						2013). A budget-neutral reallocation of public spending towards investment
						would thus support the economy’s growth potential, provided projects are
						carefully chosen, and make debt dynamics more favourable.</p>
          <p id="IDdbe45cfa-609f-4738-a3a1-da9a0cf3fc25" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Government investment would be particularly powerful if it
						helps pave the way for private investment. In the European Union, the
						Investment Plan for Europe (Juncker Plan) provides an opportunity to adjust
						public spending along these lines (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID3d743c53-79a9-448e-9ebb-4718e1f939c0"/> in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5b8949e0-1979-4e6e-bcfc-c02409915157"/>). Complementary

						lessen pressures on public budgets and strengthen output growth. Raising the
						effective retirement age can help to tackle the spending pressure that
						ageing will create and would also support the productive potential of the
						economy. Also, OECD analysis suggests that there is much scope for

						structural policy changes in an integrated, rather than a piecemeal,
						approach. First, within structural policy, attention to labour and business
						settings is important. For example, product market reforms undertaken in a
						strict labour environment tend to limit the ability of new firms to hire the
						labour they need. Alternatively, labour market reforms undertaken within a
						rigid business environment with large incumbent firms tend to force all
						adjustment onto labour. Overall, structural policies can contribute
						substantially to fiscal sustainability and soften trade-offs between fiscal
						consolidation, growth and equity objectives. But while such policy actions
						are often undertaken with a view to boosting long-run growth from the supply
						side, their short-term effects on demand are less certain and these must
						also be considered.</p>
          <p id="IDd942b768-53c2-4b82-9324-315012ab44e0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">When pro-growth structural policies are introduced in normal
						times and with the support of other macro policies, the empirical evidence
						generally points to greater short-term gains than losses. In bad times,
						however, and especially when fiscal and monetary policies are not deployed
						to offset short-run negative effects, the negative transitional dynamics
						associated with structural changes are not as easily smoothed. In such a
						situation, structural policies that boost short-run demand should be
						prioritised. They include policies that reduce entry barriers in sectors
						with pent-up demand, policies to reduce administrative burdens on firms, and
						policies that boost aggregate demand directly such as public infrastructure
						investment. Policies that improve confidence or reduce uncertainty over
						future economic conditions may offer the biggest short-term impact as they
						can rapidly boost consumption and investment through wealth effects and
						improved expectations. Examples include credible reforms to pension and
						health systems that improve the sustainability of public finances, reducing
						the need for precautionary saving and creating fiscal space for stimulus. A
						forthcoming OECD study on the short-term effects of structural reforms
						discusses these issues in greater depth (Caldera Sanchez et al., 2015).</p>

					broad categories: the real economy, the non-financial sector, the financial
					sector and public finances (International Monetary Fund, 2012; European
					Commission, 2012). Possible weaknesses in the real economy are captured by the
					difference between the potential and the actual GDP growth rate, the difference
					between the actual unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment (or
					NAIRU), the current account deficit and the evolution of relative unit labour
					costs. Indicators of financial market excesses related to the non-financial

						initiatives to strengthen infrastructure and some initial steps in tax
						reform have already been taken. The budget for 2015-16 focuses on a smaller
						set of structural reforms with less emphasis on cost-cutting measures
						compared with the previous year’s budget. It notably proposes a package of
						measures supporting small and medium enterprise, including a preferential
						rate of corporate taxation and increased tax allowances. Also of note are
						measures increasing support for child-care and proposals to tackle base
						erosion and profit shifting. The latter include new anti-avoidance
						legislation and the extension of the Goods and Services Tax to cross-border
						supplies of digital services and products. Future structural reforms should
						prioritise further tax changes, shifting away from direct taxation and
						towards indirect taxation, including reduced reliance on personal and
						corporate income taxes and measures such as increased use of the Goods and
						Services Tax and land tax. Ensuring increased well-being will also be helped
						by the proposals to increase child-care subsidies by boosting inclusion
						through positive effects on female labour participation. In environmental
						policy it remains important that the Emission Reduction Fund is efficient
						through robust measurement and verification methods and implementation of a
						safeguard mechanism that prevents offsetting emissions elsewhere in the

						restore confidence and preserve Brazil’s investment grade rating. In January
						2015, the new government announced a significant fiscal adjustment, with
						primary surplus targets of 1.2% and 2% of GDP for 2015 and 2016. The new
						targets are backed by concrete measures to reduce expenditures and – to a
						lesser extent – raise revenues. This has lent credibility to the
						consolidation plans. At the same time, the central bank adopted a more
						ambitious strategy of bringing inflation back to the 4.5% target by end-2016
						and, accordingly, has raised the policy rate further. Despite hikes in
						administrative prices and a depreciated currency, which have pushed
						year-on-year headline inflation significantly above the target range in
						early 2015, inflation expectations have declined, probably as a result of
						these stronger fiscal and monetary policies. Also, price realignments, as in
						the energy sector, are aimed at ensuring the right signals are in place for
						markets to work well. </p>

						growth. Reducing the compliance costs and distortions imposed by Brazil’s
						fragmented system of indirect taxes could provide an almost immediate cost
						reduction for firms, and could be achieved by consolidating indirect taxes
						into a single, broad-based value-added tax with full deductibility for
						inputs and an exemption for exports. This would improve competitiveness,
						adding to the effects of the depreciated exchange rate. In addition,
						reducing barriers to international trade would reduce the costs of imported
						inputs and strengthen incentives to enhance productivity by exposing
						Brazilian firms to more international competition. Lowering domestic entry
						barriers could reinforce the limited exposure of Brazilian firms to
						competitive pressures, eventually raising productivity. Improvements in
						infrastructure could also reduce transport costs, particularly for
						exporters. Although concessions already play an important role in
						infrastructure in Brazil, improvements in the regulatory environment could
						enhance predictability and boost new and sizeable investments by the private
						sector. PPPs are to play a much larger role in the upcoming concessions, in
						line with less participation by public banks, in particular BNDES.</p>

						occur over 2014-16. The latest federal budget showed that the government is
						on track to eliminate its deficit in the current fiscal year, largely
						through maintaining spending restraint. However, given lower revenues,
						particularly following the decline in oil prices that result in smaller
						projected surpluses at the federal level and deficits in some oil-producing
						provinces, less consolidation is anticipated through 2016 than in previous
						official projections. As a result, provincial governments plan to reduce
						their combined deficits by a weaker 0.3% of GDP over 2014-16. The general
						government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be fairly flat. Rising
						health-care costs will remain a longer-run challenge, and continued
						structural reforms to limit such expenditure growth are needed. Raising tax
						efficiency by relying more on environmentally related taxes would help
						achieve greener growth. In addition, reducing regressive and distortive
						income-tax expenditures could help support inclusive growth.</p>

						budget deficit is projected to narrow by 2 percentage points of GDP to 5¾
						per cent in 2016. Nevertheless, Japan is not on track to achieve its target
						of a primary surplus (central and local governments) by FY 2020, even after
						the planned hike in the consumption tax to 10% in 2017. To maintain
						confidence in Japan’s fiscal sustainability, the fiscal plan to be announced
						by the summer of 2015 should set out a detailed and credible strategy to
						achieve a primary surplus by FY 2020, including additional measures to
						constrain government spending and raise revenues. Even at 10%, the
						consumption tax will remain about half the average value-added tax rate in
						OECD countries. Additional tax revenue should come from broadening the
						personal and corporate income tax bases and increasing environmental taxes.
						It is also essential to reform pension and health and long-term care to
						constrain the growth of social spending by measures such as raising the

						2016, it is increasingly important to reduce gender gaps and to boost the

						below that of men. The low rate reflects the withdrawal of a majority of

						improving work-life balance by reducing working hours, which are more than
						20% higher than the OECD average. In addition, the 37% gender wage gap at
						median earnings is the highest in the OECD, discouraging female employment.
						The gap reflects the large share of women in non-regular jobs and the low
						share in management. It is necessary to create better job opportunities for
						women, notably by breaking down labour market dualism and expanding the role
						of performance, rather than seniority, in setting wages. In short, reforms

						strongest since the crisis. Falling mortgage interest rates combined with
						the large fall of oil prices and tax cuts is further boosting consumer
						purchasing power beyond the gains already coming from growing employment.
						The depreciation of the euro sparked by the ECB’s quantitative easing
						programme has reinforced Spain’s decline in relative unit labour costs and
						international cost competitiveness. A healthier banking sector following
						restructuring and recapitalisation, falling interest rates on corporate
						borrowing, rising corporate profitability and increased capacity utilisation
						are all expected to contribute to renewed business investment growth. </p>

						The weak recovery in the European Union – Turkey’s largest export market –
						and geopolitical crises in the major markets of Iraq and Russia have hurt
						exports. Inflation has remained well above the 5% target and the real
						effective exchange rate appreciated substantially through 2014, before a
						sharp correction in early 2015. Exporters continue to diversify from
						low-growth to high-growth markets but their overall performance weakened in
						early 2015, with negative effects on investment. Government infrastructure
						investment, which had been providing support, declined in early 2014.
						Government-supported projects outside the general government sector,

						The labour market is projected to remain solid, with further declines in the
						unemployment rate and a pick-up in wage growth associated with a recovery in
						productivity. Consumer prices should remain flat in 2015 and pick up in 2016
						as temporary effects of weaker commodity prices unwind and slack in labour

						structural rather than cyclical factors. Continued weak productivity would
						lead to lower-than-expected GDP and wage growth, and a higher-than-expected
						budget deficit. Moreover, euro area risks could hold back business
						confidence and investment. On the other hand, defining medium-term policy
						plans by the government and continuing structural reforms would boost
						productive capacity and productivity. Alternatively, growth could still be
						sustained through higher household borrowing and consumption, supported by
						stronger wages and lower commodity prices, even if productivity does not

						Recent oil-price declines have weakened investment expenditure in the
						drilling and mining sector following an earlier sustained run-up. The
						recovery of housing investment remains hesitant, in part reflecting rates of
						household formation that remain below longer-term demographic trends.
						Business investment has also weakened more broadly, reflecting the drag from

					hand in hand with the weak recovery and has reduced potential output growth. To
					escape this low equilibrium setting and push economies onto a higher growth
					path, it will be necessary to raise capital spending. This paper examines the
					potential reasons for current weak investment, against the background of secular
					trends, such as the shift of the location of investment to emerging market
					economies (EMEs), the growing importance of intangible investment and the
					declining share of investment-intensive sectors in the economy. The determinants
					of business investment are also examined: weak aggregate demand, cost of
					capital, economic and policy uncertainty, and regulatory constraints. The
					drivers of government and infrastructure investment are also considered. The
					paper concludes with an examination of the policy implications of the analysis
					to achieve a high-growth and high-investment equilibrium, with higher quality
					employment and enhanced innovation diffusion – that is, higher potential
					output.</p>

						there are a number of different indicators and measurements. The most
						commonly used are FDI flows and stocks, which are available for all
						economies and on a bilateral basis. These data measure financial flows
						across national borders that represent an ownership and control commitment.
						While importantly driven by mergers and acquisitions, these data also
						account for actual fixed capital investments undertaken by multinational
						enterprises (MNEs).<fnote id="ID-42-1141342"><p id="ID-42-1141472" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Specifically, FDI flows in balance-of-payment accounts equal the
								sum of equity flows from home to abroad, including mergers and
								acquisitions and greenfield investments, inter-company debt flows
								from parents to subsidiaries, retained earnings reinvested in those
								subsidiaries, and extensions of capital to existing affiliates and
								investments for financial restructurings (e.g. for debt repayment or
								loss reduction; see OECD (2008) for more information). These methods
								of measuring foreign investment make FDI flows a better measure of
								the financing of overseas operations through the use of internal
								capital markets rather than the actual capital expenditures of
								foreign subsidiaries.</p></fnote>  Additional information is provided by new

						from the crisis has been one factor keeping investment growth in check.
						Empirical analyses typically find that output growth has a key role in
						explaining short-term swings in investment (Chirinko, 1993). New OECD
						empirical analysis based on a model linking investment with GDP confirms the
						importance of output developments in explaining movements in business
						investment (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID50c6e2ff-bc1e-4a91-810f-90dfb451140b"/>; <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDe8e1b14e-aedf-4ece-b4be-6c043827a504"/>; <xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5cb5fdc1-8265-47c2-8021-5019ad103e17"/>).<fnote id="ID-42-1144458"><p id="ID-42-1144579" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Country-specific estimations are based on equation (1) in Annex
								3.1, where the level of investment is explained by current and
								lagged changes in real GDP, and replacement investment. An automatic
								model selection is performed allowing for up to 16 lags. For Japan,
								the model selection gives a lag length of zero. Therefore, results
								shown in Figure 3.14 are based on a model including 8 lags of change
								in output for this country.</p></fnote>  Although the findings differ somewhat across the economies
						examined, the model largely tracks the downturn in investment at the height
						of the crisis and the dynamics of investment in recent years. So, it remains
						that the predominant factor associated with sluggish investment since the
						crisis is persistently weak output developments, both domestic and global.
						In effect, many economies have become stuck in a low-growth and
						low-investment equilibrium, with persistent unemployment, stagnant wages,
						and non-robust consumption. The model and empirical work, however, would
						also be consistent with a higher-level equilibrium, whereby more robust
						investment generates more jobs, higher wages, and stronger consumption,
						which then ratifies the stronger investment. The key is how to get from the
						low-level equilibrium to the higher-level one. </p>

						OECD countries have reduced statutory corporate tax rates since 2007.
						However, in the case of multinational corporations that engage in
						tax-motivated profit shifting (OECD, 2015d), the investment response may
						have been muted. Given that they had already shifted their taxable income to
						low-tax jurisdictions, their effective average and marginal tax rates were
						already lower than domestic tax parameters would imply. Consequently,
						changes in domestic tax rates have had little effect on their effective
						rates. Indeed, recent OECD analysis finds that capital spending of such
						companies is significantly less responsive to changes in domestic tax
						systems than that of companies with limited international profit-shifting
						opportunities (Johannson et al., 2015). Some countries have also introduced
						temporary tax credits or strengthened investment allowances for a fixed

						at the margin, notably by bringing forward investment plans to benefit from

								(expressed relative to equity) was at relatively high levels in all
								economies, in part reflecting the collapse in stock markets as well
								as the build-up of corporate debt. High leverage contributed to the
								large reductions in investment volumes at the height of the crisis
								(Davis, 2010; Lewis et al., 2014). However, non-financial corporate
								leverage has subsequently declined considerably in some but not all
								countries. In the United States, Japan and the aggregate euro area
								it is now at or below pre-crisis norms for non-financial firms.
								Consequently, this source of balance sheet pressure is unlikely to
								be acting as a significant restraint on investment levels in these
								economies, unless companies aim at reaching even lower leverage. In

								have only a limited need for external finance for new investment
								projects. The present levels of corporate liquidity imply that many
								forms of corporate expenditure – including mergers and acquisitions,
								fixed investment and dividends – could rise substantially as

						significantly with the onset of the financial crisis with large losses
						threating the solvency of banking systems. Public interventions prevented a
						financial collapse, but the crisis left banks weak, reducing their
						willingness to extend credit. This was particularly relevant in vulnerable
						euro area countries, where banks had initially problems in funding
						themselves at a reasonable cost. Moreover, where the recapitalisation of
						banks was initially slow and banks continue to be burdened with large
						non-performing loans (<xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID49707a55-a7b0-4ad8-a9c5-fd1171c8fc9e"/>).
						However, according to the ECB Bank Lending Survey, over recent years, the
						cost of finance and balance sheet constraints have become less important in
						constraining the supply of credit for the euro area as a whole (ECB,
						2015).</p>
          <p id="ID232afb67-2d9b-44a9-9e0d-15cd67848483" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Insufficient profitability should no longer hamper capital
						spending by corporations in the United States, but higher profitability may
						still be needed in a number of other economies to support stronger
						investment spending. The availability of internal finance through
						profitability and cash flow can be important for investment (Bond et al.,
						2003). Weaker cash flow can exacerbate the need for external finance, and
						also affect the ability of a firm to borrow and the cost of credit. The
						available data suggest that real corporate profits (financial and
						non-financial enterprises) rose by an average of 1% per year overall in the
						past four years, compared with a four-decade average of around 3% (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDd368ba82-1570-49ed-a648-9570e91b8c8a"/>). However, there is
						considerable variation across countries, with profit growth remaining
						comparatively solid in the United States, but with the level of profits
						barely changing in real terms in the euro area and Japan. With the recovery
						in profits, the rate of return on equity (i.e. net income as a share of
						shareholders’ equity) of listed companies has returned to or exceeds
						pre-crisis levels in the United States but remains below pre-crisis levels
						in the euro area and Japan, and especially in EMEs (Blundell-Wignall and
						Roulet, 2015; OECD, 2015d). </p>

						perceived uncertainty about the economic outlook and policy developments may
						have increased markedly. At times of heightened uncertainty, postponing
						planned but hard-to-reverse decisions, such as fixed investment, can be a
						valuable option (Bernanke, 1983; Dixit and Pindyck, 1994), provided the same
						investment opportunity can be undertaken in the future. Thus, higher
						uncertainty affects investment negatively, which is confirmed in empirical
						studies (see <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDe8e1b14e-aedf-4ece-b4be-6c043827a504"/>and below), including
						the experience since the recent crisis and in particular for investment in
						structures (Ferrara and Guérin, 2015). This is also reflected in the largest
						proportion of respondents in the BIAC survey (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDe561e181-cc2f-49f6-9d3b-d67934ae2b57"/>), identifying economic and regulatory uncertainty as being a very

								above pre-crisis levels. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index
								(EPUI) is based on news stories related to uncertainty, the economy
								and policy, together with the dispersion of forecasts of inflation
								and budget deficits (Baker et al., 2013).<fnote id="ID-42-1145840"><p id="ID-42-1145924" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="y">Measures of policy uncertainty are prone to revision. From
										April 2014 the EPUI changed the indices for the European
										countries and Canada to be based solely on the news-based
										measure, while the US measure continues to be based on a
										combination of data on news searches, dispersion of
										forecasts for key variables and an index of tax code
										expirations. The full uncertainty index for the United
										States is used here but it should be noted that the
										news-based measure has been more volatile and also remained
										higher than the overall policy measure.</p></fnote>  The relatively new literature using this index, or related
								variables, has highlighted possible linkages between uncertainty,
								investment growth (European Commission, 2013, 2014; IMF, 2015; <xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDe8e1b14e-aedf-4ece-b4be-6c043827a504"/>; <xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5cb5fdc1-8265-47c2-8021-5019ad103e17"/>) and GDP growth
								(Haddow et al., 2013). The EPUI points to elevated levels of
								uncertainty from 2007 to 2011, with a sharp rise at the start of the
								financial crisis and a further increase as the euro area crisis
								intensified in the latter half of 2011 (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID83b61243-e991-40e7-847b-48e0ecac049c"/>). To this
								extent, measures of policy uncertainty provide a broadly similar
								picture to that derived from stock market volatility. However, more
								recently the alternative measures of uncertainty have diverged.
								Stock market volatility has declined towards pre-crisis norms,
								whereas the policy uncertainty indices have declined but have
								remained above pre-crisis levels, except in the United States.</p>

								concern about regulatory and tax uncertainty remains a constraint on
								business activity. Uncertainty as measured by the EPUI was probably
								related to expiring tax provisions and prospects for new taxes. The
									<shortcitation>tax code expiration</shortcitation> component of
								the US index rose rapidly in 2009, 2010 and 2012, reaching

								the resolution of US budget negotiations and the debt ceiling has
								removed an important source of uncertainty. However, at the turn of
								2014 and 2015 the component spiked again, as many temporary tax
								provisions expired, possibly having a negative effect on business
								investment. Small businesses in the United States still highlight
								uncertainty about regulation as being the greatest constraint on
								business activity. Poor sales, taxes and regulation are currently
								seen as the main problems for small businesses (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID48790c3e-4a59-48d5-91c2-55a27adc220d"/>). </p>

						deficits is costly in terms of demand stabilisation, with several studies
						suggesting that the fiscal multiplier associated with government investment
						spending is greater than 1 and higher than for other fiscal instruments. For
						example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012), using US data, find a fiscal
						multiplier of 1 for government expenditure in general, but 2.1 for
						government investment. Evidence across a range of economies also suggests
						that public investment multipliers are generally greater than those for
						government consumption and exceed 1 in some cases (Ilzetzki et al., 2011).
						For this reason, cutting public investment is one of the least desirable
						fiscal consolidation instruments (Cournède et al., 2013). This is
						particularly likely to be the case if public capital spending is cut in
						strategic areas with significant network effects, or ones in which the
						social rate of return is high, as such a policy would block investment in
						related activities.</p>

						capital to meet their fiscal consolidation objectives in the aftermath of
						the crisis. Investment in fixed capital by OECD governments declined by an
						average of 0.6% of GDP between 2010 and 2013, accounting for about
						one-quarter of fiscal consolidation efforts. The decline was much larger in
						some countries, exceeding 2.5% of GDP in Greece, Spain and Ireland and
						accounting for around two-fifths of the consolidation undertaken in Spain. A
						relationship between a country’s fiscal consolidation effort over this
						period and the cuts made to public fixed investment is evident – on average,
						1% of GDP in consolidation has been associated with a 0.3% of GDP cut in
						public investment (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID1d12119f-b579-4748-85ac-d0cece31de50"/>). Hence, such

						investment decisions are irreversible and their provision usually reflects
						some kind of market failure (such as externalities or natural monopolies)
						that needs to be addressed by government intervention. The provision and use
						of infrastructure is therefore sensitive to regulation, in particular
						concerning the desired market structure, access regimes and pricing, and
						also the burden of risks. OECD estimates suggest that reducing barriers to
						entry in network industries can foster higher rates of infrastructure
						investment (Sutherland et al., 2009).</p>
          <p id="ID181746ac-0fdc-4333-b64d-fc13e149f91d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The OECD indicators of regulation in ETCR, covering seven
						network sectors (telecoms, electricity, gas, post, rail, air passenger
						transport and road freight), show a reduction in regulatory barriers across
						almost all OECD countries between 2008 and 2013. However, a large dispersion
						across countries remains when looking at individual sectors. This can hinder
						efficiency and investment, particularly in cross-border network
						infrastructure. Improvements in the quality of trade and transport
						infrastructure could also have a significant impact on levels of
						international trade in many countries, including Turkey (Ojala and Çelebi,
						2015). New OECD firm-level evidence points to a negative impact on capital
						investment by firms operating in infrastructure sectors from product market
						regulations (including ETCR) and FDI restrictions (<xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDb74245ec-e612-424b-b02a-f78925a2a923"/>). </p>

						necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, several
						governments have encouraged investment in clean energy, notably wind and
						solar photovoltaic energy, through direct subsidisation or guaranteed
						premium feed-in tariffs from such energy sources. This has successfully
						induced a significant expansion in wind and photovoltaic energy generation
						and also efficiency gains in the clean energy sectors. International trade
						and investment have played an important role in this process. However, there
						is concern that government interventions may at times have restrained trade
						and FDI in such energy generation. Indeed, recent OECD research indicates
						that imposing local content requirements as an eligibility condition for
						subsidies or premium feed-in tariffs reduces FDI in photovoltaic energy
						generation (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID256e3cea-4b6d-48e4-a52b-dbc92dd58db4"/>).</p>

								substantial support to clean energy which has benefited both
								domestic and international investment. Globally, public support to
								clean energy amounted to USD 121 billion in 2013 (IEA, 2014b). At
								least 138 countries had implemented clean-energy support policies as
								of early 2014 (REN21, 2014). While incentive schemes had to coexist
								with investment disincentives such as Fossil Fuel Subsidies as well
								as other market and regulatory rigidities that favour fossil fuel
								incumbency in the electricity sector, they have contributed to
								enhancing clean energy investment worldwide. In addition, as
								international trade and investment have played a major role in
								decreasing their input prices, the solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind
								energy sectors have become increasingly competitive. The value chain
								and the task specialisation in the solar PV sector are described in

								perceived potential of the clean energy sector to act as a lever for
								growth and employment has led several OECD countries and emerging
								market economies (EMEs) to design green industrial policies aimed at
								protecting domestic manufacturers, notably through local-content
								requirements (LCRs). Local-content requirements typically require
								solar or wind developers to source a specific share of jobs,
								components or costs locally to be eligible for policy support or
								public tenders. A forthcoming OECD report on Overcoming Barriers to
								International Investment in Clean Energy shows that such
								requirements have been designed or implemented by at least 21
								countries, including 16 OECD and EMEs, mostly since 2009,<boxnoteref refid="ID9eff9435-1dc8-4ee1-a86b-a3f328560cd9" format="boxnoteref"/> and assesses their impacts across the

              <p id="IDe4c8dea6-e545-47ba-afe0-322f7da62b5c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In a context of global value chains, new empirical
								evidence shows that LCRs have hindered global international
								investment flows in solar PV and wind energy. This might be related
								to the fact that such policies increase the cost or downgrade the
								quality of intermediate inputs, leading to less competitive
								activities in downstream segments of the value chain, which are
								associated with more value creation (Figure below). The estimated
								detrimental effect of LCRs is slightly stronger when both domestic
								and international investments are considered. This indicates that
								LCRs do not have positive impacts on domestic investment flows.</p>

								impediment for international investors in solar PV and wind energy.
								Unsurprisingly, a majority of international investors involved in
								downstream activities of the solar and wind energy sectors selected
								LCRs as an impediment (Table below). More unexpectedly, a majority
								of international investors involved in upstream or midstream
								activities also identified LCRs as an impediment. This result
								suggests that LCRs can hinder international investment across the

					equilibrium growth path. Effectively implemented macroeconomic policy that
					stimulates aggregate demand will play an important role in reviving global
					investment. This needs to be accompanied by structural reforms that increase
					economic growth prospects in the long term and strengthen confidence and raise
					wealth and aggregate demand in the short term. The appropriate demand management
					and structural policy stances are discussed in <xref object="chapter" type="plu" cont="no" format="xref plu s" refid="ID496de466-da49-4d39-96b0-48e686d59515"/>
					<xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="and" format="xref and" refid="ID52582f1a-ea9f-4416-958d-edfdae6583fe"/>. Given the finding that
					domestic investment responds to both domestic and global demand, effective
					international co-ordination of demand management policies should be promoted.
					Joint action produces stronger effects than piecemeal measures implemented by
					individual economies in isolation. Similarly, consistent structural policies
					that remove or reduce border protection are likely to be particularly effective
					in generating profitable investment opportunities. Account also needs to be
					taken of potentially important synergies between different types of investment
					that can have favourable feedback effects. For instance, strengthening the
					domestic research base and infrastructure could help to strengthen potential
					growth as well as attract internationally mobile investments (Barrell and Pain,
					1999). In turn, these could boost domestic investment, both directly and
					indirectly through spillover effects.</p>

						extraordinarily strong stimulus and policy is set to ease further with asset
						purchases in Japan and the euro area in 2015 and 2016. The associated
						reduction in financing costs, especially for large companies, should in
						principle support capital spending. Monetary policy easing beyond what is
						now planned needs to be assessed against potential negative side effects on
						future financial stability and the potential to prompt investment projects
						with low rates of return. Macro-prudential oversight and proper cost-benefit
						analysis would leave monetary policy less encumbered. And, measures to
						improve the transmission of monetary policy are needed, notably in the euro
						area, so that companies, particularly SMEs, can benefit from easy credit
						conditions. This will require measures to strengthen the financial solidity

									in improving the regulatory environment and funding arrangements
									to ensure appropriate infrastructure provision. Long-term
									planning is particularly important in the area of infrastructure
									investment, where the construction period and service lives are
									relatively long, and where private investment may be needed to
									fill financing gaps through public-private partnerships (see
									above). In this context, exploiting to a greater degree user
									charges could help to ensure that infrastructure is used
									efficiently and identify where there are clear shortfalls (de
									Mello and Sutherland, 2014). Greater information sharing on the
									long-term financial performance of past investments in
									infrastructure assets and their associated risks would also
									benefit potential institutional investors in infrastructure.</p>

									regulatory framework are particularly important in EMEs, where
									higher perceived instability and uncertainty might deter private
									investors from providing much needed financing. To limit
									uncertainty, EMEs need to ensure that proper dispute resolution,
									contract renegotiation policies, and land acquisition policies
									are in place with regards to potential infrastructure projects
									(OECD, 2015f). Reforming the management practices and
									efficiencies of large state-owned enterprises that co-ordinate
									and undertake a lot of infrastructure-related investment in some
									EMEs is also important to enable access to funding from
									international investors. </p>

									not be subject to barriers as an open FDI regime promotes the
									best allocation of global investment. Capital spending may
									increase in both source and destination countries when vertical
									FDI is involved, leading to the build-up of global value chains.
									Nonetheless, as measured by the OECD FDI regulatory
									restrictiveness index, several OECD and non-OECD economies
									impose overt constraints on inward FDI, as reflected in the list
									of reservations lodged by adhering countries under the OECD Code
									of Liberalisation of Capital Movements. A renewed drive to ease
									or eliminate such overt barriers would spur capital spending.
									Where the main objectives of such restraints are not to keep out
									foreign capital, better targeted instruments should be used for
									such aims.</p>

								here due to data availability issues. The annual ETCR indicator is
								converted into a quarterly series by setting the four quarters of
								any year equal to the annual observation in that year.</p></fnote>  The DOLS takes care of endogeneity and serial correlation in the

						the order of integration of the variables and to see whether they are linked
						via a cointegrating vector. Panel unit root tests (Im et al., 2003) indicate
						that the potential drivers have a unit root in levels but are stationary in
						first differences. The capital stock itself seems to have a stochastic trend
						even though tests including a constant indicate that it might be even an

								sample: the gross investment-to-capital stock ratio has a unit root
								(Table 3.A1.1).</p></fnote>  Given the non-stationary nature of the data, it is necessary to
						check whether the five series of interest are linked through a cointegrating
						vector. Variants of the Pedroni cointegration test (except the panel

					alia, rates of return on equity (ROE) and the costs of equity (COE), for 10,000
					listed companies across 75 countries over the period 2002 to 2013. The data were

					companies in the world and for the most part are multi-national enterprises
					(MNEs). In the general industrial sector, these companies operate in many
					countries and hence structural policies in any one will have a more diluted
					effect. Indeed, these companies may move parts of their business operations
					between jurisdictions favouring those with more profitable possibilities. This
					is less so for the infrastructure sector, however, where the company listed in a

					postulates that capital spending grows in line with sales (the accelerator type

					explanatory variables: ROE; COE; the cost of debt proxied by the AAA bond rate
					in the country; a dummy variable for the tax status of the country as an
					investment tax free zone (TAX); the company tax rate (CITR); an earnings
					expectation variable proxied by the ratio of stock market capitalisation to GDP
					(MCAP); and a measure of banking system openness captured by a variable based on
					the persistence of deviations from covered interest parity (VCIP). This base
					model was then used to test a number of OECD structural indicators to see

						that covers a wide range of goods and service sectors (Koske et al., 2015).
						The methodology is similar to the one used by Kox et al. (2004). For each

						evidence of the existence of such a lasting interest: small participations
						that are typically not associated with a significant influence are not
						included. These FDI positions can be the result of greenfield investments or
