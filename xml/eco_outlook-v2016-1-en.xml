Policymakers: Act now 
to break out of the low-growth trap and deliver on our promises </mainhead>
      </heading>
      <p id="ID28c4a17a-5816-41ae-8495-eff0a0a04fae" instlang="en" indent="n" numbering="n">Policymaking is at an important juncture. Without comprehensive, coherent and collective action, disappointing and sluggish growth will persist, making it increasingly difficult to make good on promises to current and future generations. </p>
      <p id="ID65d2bcde-67c9-4384-bd84-25785f722b88" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Global growth has languished over the past eight years as OECD economies have struggled to average only 2 per cent per year, and emerging markets have slowed, with some falling into deep recession. In this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook </emphasis>the global economy is set to grow by only 3.3 per cent in 2017. Continuing<emphasis emph="italic"> </emphasis>the cycle of forecast optimism followed by disappointment, global growth has been marked down, by some 0.3 per cent, for 2016 and 2017 since the November <emphasis emph="italic">Outlook. </emphasis></p>
      <p id="ID7277a6b8-ddff-4da6-ba2f-343206f05825" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The prolonged period of low growth has precipitated a self-fulfilling low-growth trap. Business has little incentive to invest given insufficient demand at home and in the global economy, continued uncertainties, and a slowed pace of structural reform. In addition, although the unemployment rate in the OECD is projected to fall to 6.2 per cent by 2017, 39 million people will still be out of work, almost 6.5 million more than before the crisis. Muted wage gains and rising inequality depress consumption growth. Global trade growth, at less than 3 per cent on average over the projection period, is well below historical rates, as value-chain intensive and commodity-based trade are being held back by factors ranging from spreading protectionism to China rebalancing toward consumption-oriented growth.</p>
      <p id="ID0c415552-ea07-4ddc-ac6b-ada70f493af1" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Negative feedback-loops are at work. Lack of investment erodes the capital stock and limits the diffusion of innovations. Skill mismatches and forbearance by banks capture labour and capital in low productivity firms. Sluggish trade prospects slow knowledge transfer. These malignant forces slow down productivity growth, constraining potential output, investment, and trade. In per capita terms, the potential of the OECD economies to grow has halved from just below 2 per cent 20 years ago to less than one per cent per year, and the drop across emerging markets is similarly dramatic. The sobering fact is that it will take 70 years, instead of 35, to double living standards.</p>
      <p id="IDc28e637f-5664-4740-9b19-6406de5f40a3" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The low-growth trap is not ordained by demographics or globalization and technological change. Rather, these can be harnessed to achieve a different global growth path – one with higher employment, faster wage growth, more robust consumption with greater equity. The high-growth path would reinvigorate trade and more innovation would diffuse from the frontier firms as businesses respond to economic signals and invest in new products, processes, and workplaces. </p>
      <p id="ID31b8066e-b3bd-49bf-b3da-240d5865abb2" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">What configuration of fiscal, monetary, and structural policies can propel economies from the low-growth trap to the high-growth path, safeguarding living standards for both young and older generations? </p>
      <p id="ID9a7d8bc0-c0d4-4bdf-adf2-618bc29eadd8" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Monetary policy has been the main tool, used alone for too long. In trying to revive economic growth alone, with little help from fiscal or structural policies, the balance of benefits-to-risks is tipping. Financial markets have been signalling that monetary policy is overburdened. Pricing of risks to maturity, credit, and liquidity are so sensitized that small changes in investor attitude have generated volatility spikes, such as in late 2015 and again in early 2016. </p>
      <p id="IDb603495f-b775-47a6-a71d-042215b0d736" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Fiscal policy must be deployed more extensively, and can take advantage of the environment created by monetary policy. Governments today can lock in very low interest rates for very long maturities to effectively open up fiscal space. Prioritized and high-quality spending generates the capacity to repay the obligations in the longer term while also supporting growth today. Countries have different needs and initial situations, but OECD research points to the kind of projects and activities that have high multipliers, including both hard infrastructure (such as digital, energy, and transport) and soft infrastructure (including early education and innovation). The right choices will catalyse business investment, which, as the <emphasis emph="italic">Outlook</emphasis> of a year ago argued, is ultimately the key to propelling the economy from the low-growth trap to the high-growth path. </p>
      <p id="ID0c864cf2-bf9e-40df-9956-cbb3526c1b73" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The high-growth path cannot be achieved without structural policies that enhance market competition, innovation, and dynamism; increase labour market skills and mobility; and strengthen financial market stability and functioning. As outlined in the special chapter in this <emphasis emph="italic">Outlook</emphasis>, the OECD’s <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> and the comprehensive <emphasis emph="italic">Productivity for Inclusive Growth Nexus Report</emphasis> of the OECD Ministerial Summit, there is a coherent policy set for each country based on its own characteristics and objectives that can raise productivity, growth and equity. </p>
      <p id="IDaed680c7-d5bf-4dab-8049-b0752882b9bf" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The need is urgent. The longer the global economy remains in the low-growth trap, the more difficult it will be to break the negative feedback loops, revive market forces, and boost economies to the high-growth path. As it is, a negative shock could tip the world back into another deep downturn. Even now, the consequences of policy inaction have damaged prospects for today’s youth with 15 per cent of them in the OECD not in education, employment, or training; have drastically reduced the retirement incomes people are likely to get from pension funds compared to those who retired in 2000; and have left us on a carbon path that will leave us vulnerable to climatic disruption.</p>
      <p id="ID1409b08d-7338-4d21-a150-1f3bef44b113" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Citizens of the global economy deserve a better outcome. If policymakers act, they can deliver to raise the future path of output – which is the wherewithal for economies to make good on promises – to create jobs and develop career paths for young people, to pay for health and pension commitments to old people, to ensure that investors receive adequate returns on their assets, and to safeguard the planet. </p>

        <p id="IDf8c1f40a-1bcc-48c1-8af5-58af98193a57" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Eight years after the financial crisis, the recovery remains disappointingly weak. Global GDP growth is projected to be 3% in 2016, unchanged from last year, with only a modest improvement foreseen in 2017. Global trade growth also remains very subdued. Many emerging market economies (EMEs) have lost momentum, with sharp downturns in some, especially commodity producers. The upturn in the advanced economies remains modest, with growth held back by slow wage gains and subdued investment. Low commodity prices and accommodative monetary policies continue to offer support in many economies, albeit punctuated by periods of tightened and volatile financial conditions, especially early in the year. All this culminates in growth rates much weaker than anticipated a few years ago and well below pre-crisis norms. Moreover, such a prolonged period of slow growth has damaged the longer-run supply-side potential of economies, via the scarring effect of extended unemployment, foregone investment and the adverse impact of weak trade growth on productivity.</p>
        <p id="ID91b48663-0973-459e-9587-a53241aaf5db" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Financial instability risks also persist. EMEs have high private debt burdens and remain vulnerable to capital outflows and weaker-than-expected growth. Risks also stem from the difficulties of agreeing effective responses to policy challenges in many countries. In Europe, these include the refugee surge and the unpopularity of austerity measures in a number of countries. The forthcoming UK referendum on EU membership has already raised uncertainty, and an exit would depress growth in Europe and elsewhere substantially. In China, the risk of an abrupt near-term growth decline has eased as policy stimulus takes effect, but the choices will likely slow the rebalancing process and raise financial exposures, adding to longer term challenges.</p>
        <p id="ID1bf4fd6c-91f9-4c75-8473-73541b353076" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">To break out of this low rate of global economic growth requires comprehensive national policies, incorporating more proactive fiscal prioritisation and revived structural ambition in combination with accommodative monetary policies. It is clear that reliance on monetary policy alone has failed to deliver satisfactory growth and inflation. Additional monetary policy easing could now prove to be less effective than in the past, and even counterproductive in some circumstances. Many countries have room for fiscal expansion to strengthen activity via public investment, following the lead of China and Canada, especially as low long-term interest rates have effectively increased fiscal space, at least temporarily. Almost all countries have scope to reallocate public spending towards more growth-friendly items. Collective action across economies to raise public investment in carefully selected projects with a high growth impact would boost demand without compromising fiscal sustainability. In addition, collective efforts to revive structural reform momentum would improve productivity, resource allocation and the effects of supportive macroeconomic policies. Given the weak global economy and the backdrop of rising income inequality in many countries, structural reforms will need to focus on the possible short-term benefits for demand as well as measures to promote long-term improvements in employment, productivity growth and inclusiveness, as discussed in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDcfbe2443-76d5-4f4e-a5ef-9bf1b44e819c"/>.</p>

This reflects a combination of subdued aggregate demand, poor underlying supply-side developments, with weak investment, trade and productivity growth, and diminished reform momentum. In recent months, soft domestic demand in the advanced economies, especially the United States, has added to the pressures stemming from the growth slowdown in many EMEs. Policy stimulus is helping to hold up demand in China, but deep recessions persist in Brazil and Russia. Global trade growth is again weak this year (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDadbdb7ea-0e8b-498b-a7c6-c0fe7cfa7500"/>), with little or no growth in the first quarter, especially in many Asian economies, consistent with the recent slowdown in the level of new orders in global business surveys. Though firming recently, commodity prices remain relatively low, reflecting ample supply and persisting concerns about future demand strength. Financial market sentiment has improved after considerable volatility earlier in the year. Nevertheless, declines in equity prices and stronger effective exchange rates, and in the United States a further tightening of credit conditions, mean that aggregate financial conditions in the major economies generally remain tighter than in the latter half of 2015, despite additional supportive monetary policy measures in the euro area and Japan (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID7d1a2ed9-8ee3-44ed-bcbd-b9f23d922d01"/>).</p>

A gradual upturn in wage growth is projected to support domestic demand as the labour market approaches full employment, with a slow improvement in productivity growth limiting the emergence of labour market pressures. In Japan, GDP growth is likely to remain modest, with the tightening labour market having only a limited impact on nominal wage growth and sizeable fiscal consolidation projected in 2017. In the euro area, growth is projected to improve slowly, helped by the gradual impact of recent monetary policy easing on credit growth and, in some countries, additional fiscal spending to assist asylum seekers. However, still sizeable labour market slack, elevated debt burdens and non-performing loans continue to hamper the recovery in some countries.</p>

However, EMEs are likely to experience diverse outcomes, reflecting differences in available policy support, the impact of low commodity prices, progress in enacting structural reforms and the extent of financial vulnerabilities. GDP growth is projected to continue moderating gradually in China, to around 6¼ per cent in 2017, as the economy rebalances from manufacturing to services. Recent fiscal policy measures provide considerable support to growth, via infrastructure and real estate investment, but also add to the challenges of achieving a smooth rebalancing and avoiding financial tensions. Solid growth should persist in India and Indonesia, helped respectively by a large planned increase in public sector wages and substantially higher infrastructure spending. The outlook for Brazil and Russia remains challenging, given the hit to incomes from low commodity prices, still high inflation, fiscal difficulties and, in Brazil, heightened political uncertainty. </p>

However, in the second half of 2015, investment levelled off and demand for commercial and industrial loans weakened. This was associated with lower profits, increasing defaults and a sharp fall in investment by oil producing companies as global oil prices collapsed. As these effects ease, business investment should pick up, supported by generally healthy corporate finances, although soft global demand conditions could offset more favourable domestic demand. Companies have reduced their leverage and hold large amounts of cash and deposits. Housing investment is expected to be more robust, reflecting pent-up demand, rising incomes and still favourable financing conditions.</p>

So far, bank lending to enterprises has barely grown in the area as a whole. However, loan demand by enterprises has increased, reflecting the low cost of credit and increasing needs for working capital and fixed investment. The total cost of bank borrowing for enterprises has fallen, especially in countries hardest hit by the crisis, and intra euro area differences in bank rates have diminished. Credit standards on loans to enterprises have also continued to ease. Nevertheless, modest growth prospects together with political uncertainty (see below) and not fully resolved problems in the banking sector mean that investment will grow at a broadly similar pace as in recent years. </p>

In China, total investment has moderated over the past year but policy-induced investment in infrastructure and real estate has already begun to offset this weakness. In Brazil and Russia, investment is set to continue declining given the prolonged recession, political uncertainty and low commodity prices. In contrast, in India and Indonesia, strong investment is expected to continue, helped by reforms to bolster infrastructure spending and robust demand growth. </p>

As in recent years, the very low cost of capital is not likely to offset weak confidence or heightened uncertainty. On the other hand, more robust policy reforms to improve competitive conditions could be an impetus for investment (Chapter 3 in OECD, 2015b). In oil producing countries, adjustment to investment in the energy-related sectors will hinge upon developments in oil prices, with a renewed decline in prices implying further fall in investment. In several EMEs, repeated downward revisions to expected potential growth, reduced rates of return and the build-up of excess capacities in some sectors may constrain investment (OECD, 2016b).</p>

In retrospect, however, the pre-crisis period may have been unusual, in part due to the boost from a strong one-time boom in manufacturing and investment in China that raised commodity demand and imports of intermediate and capital goods. A slow transformation away from investment and export-led growth in China, and a growing tendency for some Chinese firms to use domestically-produced intermediate inputs (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID6e7fd8b4-6bc4-4402-8451-530cc850c2e0"/>), appears to be an important structural factor behind the more recent softening of the global trade-GDP elasticity. The weak post-crisis recovery in investment, with global capital goods imports largely stagnating from 2011, is a persisting cyclical factor. </p>

Indeed, the number of trade restrictive measures introduced by G-20 countries since the onset of the crisis now covers around 6% of G-20 merchandise imports (OECD/WTO/UNCTAD, 2015). G-20 economies continued to add new trade restrictive measures through 2015, with over three-quarters of the total measures imposed since 2008 still in place. With around three-quarters of global trade comprising purchases of intermediate inputs, capital goods and services that contribute to final production (OECD, 2015a), the cost of barriers to cross-border trade can quickly cumulate along value chains. Barriers to cross-border foreign investments may also hit export capacity in some countries.</p>
          <p id="IDf34bc875-a25d-498a-95da-587fdf37bf68" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Moving from the pace of trade growth in the two decades prior to the crisis to trade growth becoming aligned with GDP growth could reduce the level of total factor productivity by around 4 percentage points after 20 years, all else equal, drawing on estimates in Égert and Gal (forthcoming) (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID8f1a6adb-684e-4ceb-a8fe-f4645b82381d"/>). The slowdown in production fragmentation in global value chains reinforces these adverse effects on productivity substantially. Slower trade growth and reduced participation in global value chains both limit the diffusion of innovations at the global frontier to national firms (Adalet McGowan et al., 2015). Weaker competition also discourages incentives to innovate and invest, and hampers the growth of the most productive domestic firms, especially in smaller economies in which the minimum efficient scale of production is high relative to the size of the home market. Better framework policies and the institutional environment, particularly with regard to barriers to the entry of new firms and obstacles to the exit of less efficient ones, have an important bearing on the productivity outcome (Saia et al., 2015).</p>

The new Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is a welcome step in this regard, and will boost trade growth and global activity in the medium term (Petri and Plummer, 2012). Ratification and prompt implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, reached two years ago in Bali, would provide a further stimulus. Regulatory reforms in services are also needed to reduce trade facilitation costs and increase cross-border competition, particularly in network industries and commercial services which are increasingly incorporated in merchandise trade. Anti-competitive regulation is generally higher in services and there is much wider dispersion across countries. In Europe, implementing the EU single market directives and reducing regulatory differences could raise cross-border trade and investment substantially, possibly by up to one-fifth (Fournier, 2015; Fournier et al., 2015). </p>

This is likely to reflect better anchored inflation expectations, downward nominal rigidities at a time when inflation is very low, and a smaller impact of domestic pressures on consumer price inflation, with globalisation leading to more consumer items being imported (IMF, 2006; Pain et al., 2008; Woodford, 2010; and IMF, 2013). </p>

Inflation projections continue to be surrounded by upside and downside risks in part due to uncertain oil price developments. Oil prices and inflation will be lower if oil supply does not adjust downwards and a possible renewed weakness in global economic activity damps demand for oil. An effective agreement among the main oil producers to cut production and stronger global activity would lead to higher inflation, but recent meetings to coordinate producers have failed to achieve consensus and global growth projections remain modest. Similarly, large exchange rate moves will affect domestic prices, especially in small open economies. Risks of further currency depreciations, and thus stronger inflation, are particularly high in EMEs and the United Kingdom.</p>

In the run-up to the referendum, financial markets have increasingly begun to price in the possible risk of Brexit, with a depreciation of sterling and an increase in risk premia across several asset types. Business confidence has eased, policy uncertainty has risen and investment growth has slowed. However, the projections are conditional on the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union, with growth beginning to pick up from the latter half of 2016. A decision to exit would result in considerable additional volatility in financial markets and an extended period of uncertainty about future policy developments, with substantial negative consequences for the United Kingdom, the European Union and the rest of the world. This is illustrated in a recent OECD analysis (Kierzenkowski et al., 2016):</p>

A shock to sentiment could also be reflected in households and companies temporarily postponing spending decisions amid tighter credit conditions. A sharp depreciation of sterling could mitigate these effects, but at the same time hurt other European economies and raise UK inflation. Overall, this would reduce UK GDP growth significantly in the latter half of 2016 through to 2018, possibly by around ½ percentage point per annum on average. By 2018, there would be a significant hit to activity in other European economies, especially those who have strong economic linkages with the United Kingdom (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID434c2e19-dee3-44bd-adf2-57fb3dad4b48"/>), with many non-European economies also experiencing a decline in output due to weaker demand in Europe.</p>

There likely would be a marked change in the UK trade regime, raising barriers to market access for many exporters, especially in the European Economic Area and in the 53 countries with which the European Union has trade agreements. This would provide a renewed shock to demand through the trade channel, and likely keep economic uncertainty elevated for a considerable period. By 2020, GDP in the United Kingdom could be over 3% below the level it might otherwise have been if it had remained in the European Union, with GDP in the rest of the European Union around 1% weaker than otherwise.</p>

In the longer term, the impact of exit on the United Kingdom would depend on supply-side effects. Lower trade openness would hit economic dynamism and productivity. The reduced access to the EU market would also lower inward foreign direct investment, with associated adverse effects on innovation and managerial quality. The weaker UK economy, as well as possible new restrictions after exit from the European Union, would lower net migration inflows, adding to the supply-side challenges by reducing the size of the labour force. Some of these effects could be offset by reductions in domestic regulatory burdens, but the overall net effect on living standards would be strongly negative. By 2030, UK GDP could be over 5% lower than otherwise if exit had not occurred.</p>

The stylised scenarios set out in this Box provide some illustrative estimates of the possible impact on global activity by 2018, using simulations on the NiGEM global macro model, building on Kierzenkowski et al. (2016).</p>
              <p id="ID75c7192f-5148-4b03-8716-c2bc9c77f9fb" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In the United Kingdom, financial market shocks are assumed to be of a magnitude similar to those observed during the acute phase of the euro area crisis in 2011-12, but much smaller than during the financial crisis in 2008-09. Investment and equity risk premia in the United Kingdom are raised by 50 basis points in the first half of 2016, 150 basis points over 2016H2-2017 and 100 basis points in 2018. This broadly reflects the stylised shock reported by Kierzenkowski et al. (2016), based on a two standard deviation increase in the UK economic policy uncertainty index and in UK stock market volatility. The wedge between bank borrowing and lending rates for the household and corporate sectors is also raised by 100 basis points over 2016H2-2017, reflecting the possibility that enhanced uncertainty could tighten credit conditions. Finally, the term premium on UK government long-term bonds is raised, initially by 20 basis points in 2016 and then by 50 basis points in 2017 and 2018. After 2018, these financial shocks can be expected to fade gradually, although not completely, since formal exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (assumed to take place in 2019 in Kierzenkowski et al. (2016)) would itself be an additional source of uncertainty and additional risk. </p>

Higher saving adds to the negative impact on consumption from the decline in activity and lower asset prices. To take this effect into account, an additional shock was applied, raising the ex ante household saving rate in the United Kingdom by a little over 1 percentage point in the latter half of 2016.</p>

The impact of this depreciation is likely to be more limited than in the past, but at the margin it would be likely to reduce the overall impact of the other forces acting on the UK economy, whilst adding to challenges in other economies, especially in Europe. A 10% depreciation of sterling against the US dollar is assumed to occur in mid-2016, with all other bilateral exchange rates held unchanged. The depreciation is assumed to be persistent, but to gradually fade over the simulation period. On average, the sterling effective exchange rate is around 6% below baseline in 2017 and 4% below baseline by 2018, implying an appreciation of the euro and other currencies relative to sterling. Other bilateral exchange rates are held constant.</p>

The resulting uncertainty would lead to more difficult financial conditions in other European countries. To illustrate the possible magnitude of such factors, investment and equity risk premia and the spread between household borrowing and deposit rates are widened in all European Economic Area (EEA) countries plus Switzerland. </p>

              <p id="ID-42-1128461" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The NiGEM model was run in backward-looking mode, reflecting a judgment that in a period characterised by considerable uncertainty, businesses and households would be unlikely to behave as if the future was known with certainty. Monetary policy was left exogenous (although the depreciation of sterling changes UK monetary conditions), and the budget targeting rule was left unchanged, implying that governments react to the various shocks by attempting to maintain their announced budget path. Differences across economies in their response to the shocks imposed reflect the strength of trade linkages with all other European economies, differences in the sensitivity of domestic demand to changes in financial conditions and differences in the sensitivity of trade to changes in the real exchange rate.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1128466" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"> The results indicate that Brexit would generate a large negative shock to the UK economy by 2018, with UK GDP declining between 1¼ and 1½ per cent relative to baseline by that time (see figure below), as in Kierzenkowski et al. (2016). Around 1 percentage point of this stems directly from the financial shocks in the United Kingdom (including the sterling depreciation), with the remainder stemming from the adverse impact on demand of the additional financial shocks in other European countries. The near-term hit to the UK economy would be larger without the depreciation of sterling. Whilst cushioning the decline in activity, this initially raises inflationary pressures, through higher import prices, adding around ½ percentage point to consumer price inflation in 2016-17. Business investment weakens significantly, by over 10% in 2017 and 2018 relative to baseline, and the unemployment rate is ¾ percentage point higher by 2018.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1128471" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Output in the other European economies is reduced by around 1 percentage point by 2018. Around four‑tenths of this stems directly from the UK financial shocks (including the sterling depreciation), with the remainder stemming from the additional financial shocks in their own economies. Overall, the hit to the economies most exposed to the United Kingdom is around a ¼ percentage point higher than that to the economies with a comparatively low exposure to the United Kingdom. A larger sterling depreciation against domestic currencies would magnify the negative impact on other European economies, as would any deeper confidence shocks in those economies. On the other hand, a euro depreciation could help to offset some of the negative impact, but at the expense of magnifying the negative effects on output in the UK and non-European economies.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1128814" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Weaker demand in the European economies also adversely affects the rest of the world, with GDP in the BRIICS and other non-OECD economies lowered by over ½ percentage point by 2018. Within these groups, Turkey and Russia are relatively heavily hit, reflecting their comparatively strong trade linkages with the European economies. </p>

In such a scenario, equity prices would drop further and risk premia for euro area sovereign and corporate bonds would increase by more, slowing GDP growth more substantially. Together with a fall in the euro, this would add to pressures on private and public finances, especially in countries where debt remains high. This risk would compound the existing political tensions in the European Union related to high refugee inflows and ongoing financial efforts to stabilise Greece. Downside risks to global activity also relate to a possible escalation of conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>

So far, the reaction of financial markets has been positive: stock markets have stabilised, the fall in foreign exchange reserves has ceased, the renminbi has strengthened against the US dollar, and capital outflows have eased. These particular policy measures will, however, inevitably slow the necessary rebalancing of current and capital expenditures that needs to occur and entail the risk that already-high leverage, excess industrial capacity and public debt could increase further. Indeed, year-on-year credit growth for the whole economy continues to increase around twice as fast as nominal GDP and China's fiscal rating outlook has been downgraded by one of the main rating agencies. In this context, a sharper slowdown in China and ensuing financial turbulence remain a risk which could have a sizeable negative impact on global growth (OECD, 2015e).</p>

However, several domestic vulnerabilities persist in some EMEs, even though many are better placed than before past crises, with higher foreign exchange reserves and lower public debt (<xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID7c153f5c-1aef-423f-8738-47698a78e391"/>).</p>

In Brazil and Russia, both of which remain mired in recession, and in China, Indonesia and Turkey, the debt of non-financial corporations as a percentage of GDP increased by between 40 and 120 percentage points between 2007 and the third quarter of 2015 (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDe05c9e66-1a70-45fd-96de-caa206f42dae"/>). While EMEs have benefited from favourable costs of borrowing, both domestically and from abroad, since 2014 these costs have been increasing for many of them. Moreover, the profitability of non-financial corporations in EMEs as a whole has been on the decline since late 2011 (Chui et al., 2016; OECD, 2016b). In Brazil, China and Turkey, household indebtedness also nearly doubled over the same period (but from a low level).</p>

Regarding foreign currency exposures, one possibility is that currency risks have been hedged successfully, either due to a high proportion of revenues in foreign currencies or via financial instruments. For commodity producers, whose export revenues are also largely in US dollars, the natural hedge has been weakened by the decline in global commodity prices. A further possibility is that large debt repayments have not yet come due. Government interventions in some countries have also eased the stress, with central banks effectively acting as the lender of last resort and using foreign exchange reserves to provide foreign currency swap lines for affected businesses.<fnote id="IDb574c5ff-cad9-4d8d-8976-483338278fcd"><p id="ID1fbb666c-4496-4b10-8342-d6d92451b7d9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">For instance, the central bank in Brazil has offered currency swaps that protect their holders from currency depreciations, with the losses born by the fiscal authorities. </p></fnote> Non-performing loans in the banking sector have been rising in several countries, including India where growth has been comparatively robust, but the increase is surprisingly small in the countries with large GDP declines. This may reflect supervisory leniency, allowing some banks to delay classifying domestic loans as non-performing. Such actions help to safeguard financial stability in the near term. However, they add to moral hazard and if maintained for a long period will prevent resource reallocation from non-viable firms, with possible negative effects on productivity and employment growth.</p>

Policy needs differ across countries, reflecting differences in their cyclical position, past policy measures and resulting policy space. Adopting a more co-ordinated and comprehensive policy approach both within and across countries offers the prospect of breaking out of the low-level global growth environment, where doubling the standard of living of citizens in OECD economies would take seventy years, more than twice as long as two decades ago.</p>

However, shifting the focus of the stimulus towards reducing precautionary household saving (through supportive pension, education and health policies) would spur the desired transformation toward a more service and consumption-based economy and temper the financial risks associated with high debt burdens and equity and exchange rate volatility. In Brazil and Russia, sharp recessions call for accommodative policy but the scope for stimulus is limited in view of high budget deficits and inflation. Government spending should be reduced in line with lower commodity prices, with cuts focused on subsidies rather than infrastructure and education where the negative consequences for growth are magnified. The expected moderation of inflation and recent appreciation of domestic currencies provide some room for lowering policy interest rates. Similarly, in India, if inflation continues to decline, the monetary authorities could cut interest rates in 2017, whilst further steps should be taken to improve monetary policy transmission. The Indian authorities should also continue to reduce the budget deficit via improved tax mobilisation, while shifting more spending towards physical and social infrastructure.</p>

In this context, life insurers with capital buffers close to the regulatory minimum have already been investing more in riskier assets (IMF, 2016). Greater sensitivity to interest rates has also raised the correlation of the stock price of life insurers, suggesting greater systemic risk.</p>

This, with unchanged monetary policy abroad, should weaken the domestic currency. Negative interest rates should also encourage banks to take more risks and thus ease credit conditions (Buiter and Panigirtzoglou, 2003), and could strengthen the portfolio rebalancing channel when combined with large-scale purchases of long-term bonds and thus lower longer-term interest rates (Goodfriend, 2000).</p>
              <p id="IDa816f592-06bd-4143-b826-0eb177adf16d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Negative policy interest rates have been passed through to short-term market interest rates. Money market rates have turned negative in all economies adopting such measures apart from Hungary and Norway, and, in Denmark and Sweden, interest rates on large time deposits have fallen below zero too (Jensen and Spange, 2015; Jackson, 2015; table below). In most countries, longer-term bond yields and bank lending interest rates have also declined, with some rates turning negative. However, these effects cannot be entirely attributed to interest rate cuts as several central banks have continued to buy government and private bonds. However, in Denmark and Switzerland, selected bank lending rates and fees have been raised (Bech and Malkhozov, 2016).</p>

Nevertheless, negative interest rates have likely helped limit the appreciation pressures in Denmark and Switzerland. However, in the euro area, the effective exchange rate first depreciated by nearly 10% but then reverted back to the initial level, while in Japan the yen appreciated. </p>

              <p id="ID-42-1131152" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">If implemented in pure form, negative interest rates would have side effects with a perverse impact on loan demand and growth, as they reduce banks’ profitability when lower returns on reserves held at central banks cannot be offset by lower funding costs. However, as implemented and in conjunction with current bank behaviour, the theoretical outcome is not observed. Interest costs on banks’ funds at central banks have so far been limited and tiny compared to banks’ profits (table below, final column). This stems from various forms of exemptions (tiered reserve systems in Denmark, Japan, Norway and Switzerland; exemption for required reserves in the euro area and Japan). In Sweden, the costs are lowered as banks effectively do not use the deposit facility given that they can purchase Riksbank’s certificates or use overnight fine-tuning operations that are remunerated at less negative interest rates than the deposit rate. Consequently, in all countries the average interest rates on funds placed in the central banks are less negative than the central banks’ deposit rates. Currently, the system is the least costly in Japan, Hungary and Norway. In Japan, banks as a whole continue to earn net positive interest income from excess reserves. In Hungary, the negative deposit rate effectively does not apply as there is no excessive liquidity and banks can use the 3-month deposit facility remunerated at a positive interest rate (currently at 1.2%). Similarly, in Norway, banks have kept deposits at Norges Bank largely below the quotas and thus deposits have been remunerated at a positive sight deposit rate (currently at 0.5%).</p>

The possibility for banks to compensate profit losses will depend on their business models and competition pressures. It will be particularly limited for banks with a large share of retail deposits, given that passing negative interest rates risks widespread withdrawals, especially of small retail deposits, as storing small amounts of cash is not very costly. Japan will be the exception despite the Bank of Japan's intention to sustain asset purchases, as the negative-interest tier has been capped at around 30 trillion yen.</p>

Almost all countries have room to reallocate spending and taxation towards items that offer more support to growth (Cournède et al., 2014). The need to expand public investment is pressing in many countries, reflecting the extent to which infrastructure spending, including necessary maintenance, was deferred as part of past consolidation efforts. Such measures would be particularly beneficial in countries where the initial level of public capital is low, and returns to investment are accordingly likely to be high, and in countries where demand has been persistently weak (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID90b06575-002d-411e-983c-0893612b4562"/>). A commitment to raising public investment collectively would boost supply and demand while also improving fiscal sustainability. In particular, collective action across OECD countries to expand investment spending could raise the first-year multiplier effect by around one-half on average in some major advanced countries (OECD, 2015e). </p>

              <p id="ID1e8f04c7-2279-4895-8b3d-09edf661ae40" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Unusually low interest rates offer most OECD countries a temporary increase in fiscal space that can be exploited to increase public investment. Long-term rates are unprecedentedly low in nominal terms, in particular in Japan, France and Germany, and negative in real terms in some countries. They justify any public investment projects that have an expected positive real rate of return after allowing for risk. At the same time, infrastructure needs are sizeable in OECD countries, especially as fiscal consolidation in recent years has pushed down public capital spending to very low levels in many countries. In such a situation, additional public investment is likely to benefit from high rates of return (Fournier, forthcoming).</p>
              <p id="IDa663526d-9d02-4cc0-8903-13281475b328" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">OECD analysis suggests that increasing good-quality public investment is likely to bring output gains, whose amplitude will vary across countries (OECD, 2015e, and Mourougane et al., forthcoming). A permanent budget-neutral increase in public investment of 0.5% of GDP in each single economy, assuming fixed interest rates, helps stimulate demand in the short term with growth effects of around 0.3-0.4% in the first year in the major advanced economies. Being relatively closed, the United States gets stronger output gains than more open economies, such as the European countries and Canada. By contrast, the ability of Japan to stimulate its economy through additional public investment will depend on the size of its fiscal multipliers, which has been very hard to estimate in the most recent period (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2014), and the type of projects chosen. Thanks to the increase in output, the public debt-to-GDP ratio falls in the short term notwithstanding the increase in debt levels, by around 0.3‑0.4 percentage point of GDP in most of the countries.</p>
              <p id="IDd1a19891-12f6-4896-a202-f0e1db9f04aa" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">An investment-led stimulus of 0.5% of GDP in each single economy could also have longer-term benefits, although these are hard to pin down precisely. Depending on the modelling approach used, the long-term output gains could amount to between 0.5% and 2% in the large advanced economies (figure below). There are substantial uncertainties regarding the long-term impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio, reflecting different output gains, changes to the price level and the extent to which budget neutrality is achieved in the different types of models. A sustained rise in the stock of public capital and in potential output will help reduce risks on debt, notably in small European economies. </p>
              <p id="ID48753be7-4cc7-4ebb-b528-a9a72175fee6" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Countries where the initial level of capital is low are likely to benefit the most from the stimulus on the assumption that all forms of additional investment have a high rate of return in these economies. Amongst the large advanced economies, the effect on output would be above average in Germany and the United Kingdom, where the stock of public capital is relatively low. On the other hand, depending on the type of project chosen, the output gains could be very negative for Japan, reflecting a large initial public capital stock and associated low marginal rates of return. Lowering returns to public capital by one standard deviation would significantly reduce the long-term effect on output, which would now amount to 0.7% on average for the OECD countries and 0.5% for the major advanced countries. </p>
              <p id="ID8fb0fcaf-348c-41c1-9da7-56755486f9b2" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">If persistent demand weakness gradually undermines the productive capacity of the economy (<shortcitation>hysteresis</shortcitation>) the case for an investment-led stimulus is reinforced, as the stimulus would lead to stronger long-term output gains. The amplitude of these gains depends on the initial situation in the business cycle, and to a lesser extent on the degree of labour market rigidity. They would be particularly important for Italy and France.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1132881" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Collective action among the major advanced economies to raise good-quality public investment is estimated to bring additional GDP gains of about 0.2 percentage point on average after one year in the economies concerned compared to a scenario where countries act individually, taking the first-year multiplier above unity in almost all countries. This would represent a gain of around one-half on average in all the major advanced economies but Japan, where the gains are uncertain as mentioned above. As a consequence, the debt-to-GDP ratio would also fall more than otherwise. Germany would be, amongst the major advanced economies, the country that benefits the most from collective action to boost public investment. </p>
              <p id="ID-42-1132886" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Some structural reforms can increase the short-term growth impact of an investment-led stimulus and accentuate the extent to which it lowers the debt-to-GDP ratio. In particular, reforms targeted at frictions that hold back demand for investment, such as increasing product market competition, can lower the opportunity costs of investing. Lowering product market regulations by the average improvement over two years in a typical OECD country could add around 0.1-0.3 point to the growth impact after the first year. The resulting effects on public debt ratios would be marked in Japan, Italy and France, by around 1 percentage point after one year.</p>

Possible near-term clean energy measures include improvements to public building standards, new low emission vehicles in public transport and new <shortcitation>smart</shortcitation> technologies (OECD, 2015e).

In recent years, the pace of structural reforms in both advanced and EMEs has slowed. This slowdown is particularly troubling for long-term growth prospects. Actions across a broad range of reform objectives, such as product market competition, labour mobility and financial market robustness are essential in order to help to reverse the widespread slowdown in productivity and improve inclusiveness by addressing poor labour market performance and widening wage dispersion (<xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDcfbe2443-76d5-4f4e-a5ef-9bf1b44e819c"/>). </p>

Aside from higher investment in public infrastructure, these include reductions of barriers to entry in services sectors with pent-up demand, as well as reforms in the area of housing policies and job-search assistance to facilitate geographic and job mobility. Additional labour market measures may, however, be needed to support low-skilled and low-income workers, who are the most vulnerable to job loss when competitive pressures intensify. Reforms that initially place downward pressure on economy-wide wages are less likely to offer short-run benefits at a time of weak demand. </p>

However, when the economy is weak, the short-term effect can be less favourable and have negative implications for longer-term growth and reform effectiveness. Against the current background of subdued global economic prospects, there is a need to prioritise structural reforms that, in addition to stimulating productivity and employment, can yield positive short-term gains in domestic demand. As outlined in the latest <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth Interim Report</emphasis> (OECD, 2016a), reform strategies that should be prioritised in the current weak economic environment include:</p>

Examples include taxi and professional services (legal, accounting, architecture and engineering).

To this end, speeding-up the restructuring of non-performing loans through stronger bank supervision, debt enforcement and insolvency frameworks is needed. The resolution of the large amount of distressed debt on banks' balance sheets would also facilitate the development of a market for such assets. In this context, the latest private-sector agreement among Italian financial institutions to create a fund to support the recapitalisation of weaker lenders and facilitate the establishment of a secondary market for non-performing loans, together with the government promise to markedly speed up bankruptcy procedures, are welcome. Improving corporate governance of financial institutions is an important complement to new institutional frameworks.</p>

Fiscal account projections are consistent with growth, inflation and wage projections. Where government plans have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. Where there is insufficient information to determine the allocation of the aggregate change in the fiscal balance, the presumption is that it applies equally to the spending and revenue sides, and is spread proportionally across their main components.</p>

        <p id="ID05a21ce3-1f60-4a26-a278-96c371d1be42" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The following tables show the position of OECD and selected non-OECD countries on a number of indicators that could reveal potential exposure to financial turbulence. The main focus of Table 1.A2.1 is on domestic vulnerabilities of the OECD and BRIICS countries, that of Table 1.A2.2 on financial account vulnerabilities of the OECD and non-OECD G-20 countries. The presented variables are a subset of over 70 vulnerability indicators identified as useful in monitoring risks of a costly crisis in OECD economies (Röhn et al., 2015).</p>
        <p id="IDefdd81ca-d3a6-4526-94a5-8be18e7338b1" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Table 1.A2.1 presents indicators typically associated with financial vulnerabilities arising primarily from the domestic economy, in four broad categories: the real economy, the non-financial sector, the financial sector and public finances (International Monetary Fund, 2012; European Commission, 2012; Hermansen and Röhn, 2015). Possible weaknesses in the real economy are captured by the difference between the potential and the actual GDP growth rate, the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment (or NAIRU), the current account deficit and the evolution of relative unit labour costs. Indicators of financial market excesses related to the non-financial sector are the debt of households and non-financial corporations and real house price growth. An aggregated ratio of core Tier-1 capital to total assets (i.e. the leverage ratio) for selected banks in each country,<fnote id="ID8272830b-daf7-4ee5-8dca-d5678f639fe6"><p id="IDb8ee904c-c70d-4bf8-94ca-3a4fb02cd5e3" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The calculations of the country leverage ratios are based on over 1200 commercial banks, including 915 in the United States, 197 in the OECD euro area countries, 23 in the United Kingdom, 11 in Canada and 7 in Japan.</p></fnote> non-performing loans, and financial corporations’ debt are included to account for the direct risk exposure of the financial sector. Vulnerabilities stemming from the public sector are quantified along three dimensions: government net borrowing, gross government debt and the difference between 10-year real sovereign bond yields and the potential real GDP growth rate. Higher values, with the exception of the leverage ratio, indicate a larger vulnerability. Table 1.A2.1 also includes the current sovereign credit ratings issued by Standard and Poor’s.</p>

Monetary and fiscal policies that strengthen aggregate demand, in particular through stronger investment, would increase productivity and household income. By boosting job creation and employment, they would also work towards undoing the rise in inequality that is due to the downturn since the global financial crisis.</p>

Shifting spending towards education and public investment is likely to raise productivity. Improvements in the effectiveness of early childhood and primary education would be particularly beneficial for disadvantaged groups. Reductions in corporate income taxes and fiscal incentives for innovation tend to lift productivity.</p>

They tend to increase wage disparity among workers but, thanks to higher job creation, have no strong influence on overall income inequality. When packaged with an increase in the effectiveness of active labour market programmes, such policies can promote both productivity and equality. The effects of job protection regulations on productivity and inequality are empirically less well established.</p>

Write-downs of non-performing loans and faster bank recapitalisations help households deleverage and facilitate the provision of new credit. Phasing out too-big-to-fail guarantees and restricting compensation practices that reward short-term success bear the promise of promoting both productivity and equality.</p>

Since the early 2000s, however, productivity growth has declined in advanced countries. This slowdown in productivity has taken place during a period in which income inequality has increased in many economies. To put the most recent years in historical context: never in the past 30 years has productivity growth been lower than since the global financial crisis, and never has income inequality been higher than it is today.</p>
        <p id="ID798dc284-abf1-48b3-aac1-f465630350f5" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The productivity slowdown and the rise in inequality have impacted the well-being of many workers and their families. Low- and middle-income households have had to cope with slow-growing, and in some cases stagnant or falling, real incomes. These trends are threatening progress in living standards, fiscal sustainability and social cohesion. Macroeconomic policy measures and structural reforms are necessary to promote productivity and curb the rise in inequality.</p>

The first part documents, and explains, the trends in productivity growth and income inequality. The second part outlines policies that can create synergies between higher productivity and lower inequality. The chapter summarises some of the research findings and highlights outstanding questions on themes that are explored in greater depth in the OECD report on the productivity-inclusiveness nexus (OECD, 2016a).</p>

For several economies, the productivity slowdown goes back to the early 2000s. But since the global financial crisis the decline in productivity growth has become much more pronounced and has affected nearly every country in the OECD. Slowing productivity, not declining employment, has been the principal factor behind slowing GDP per capita. Discussions about productivity growth have therefore taken centre-stage in policy circles, reflected for example in the creation of productivity commissions in many countries.</p>
          <p id="IDc82e9df0-98fb-4884-ae9c-862f8a60926a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Hourly labour productivity growth in OECD countries averaged 2.0% during 1990-2000, 1.9% during 2000-07 and 0.9% during 2007-14 (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDcb04ed55-5e3b-4366-82fb-1db385d37b15"/>). From the 1990s to 2007, OECD economies experienced different productivity trends, with productivity slowing in 19 countries and accelerating in 14. The United States is among the countries where productivity accelerated in the early 2000s, while productivity slowed in the euro area and Japan. Most worrying are the developments since the global financial crisis, when productivity has grown at less than half the rate in the 1990s.</p>

It is also apparent when productivity growth is corrected for the business cycle, even if such adjustments are difficult given the protracted slow recovery. Some of the post-crisis decline is thus likely to remain when economies will be back at full employment. In a longer historical perspective, the low growth rates of the 2000s have been even more unusual, as growth until the 1970s was very strong (OECD, 2015a). More recently, productivity has also slowed in some emerging market economies, including China and Russia, although on average less markedly than in advanced countries.</p>

          <p id="ID7b69c787-e74c-4da2-863d-5d8d7b23dae8" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Declining productivity growth has been bad news for workers, since it has reduced the room for productivity-driven real labour income growth. The picture has, however, been even gloomier for two reasons (Kappeler et al., 2016): average labour income has grown less than productivity, and labour income inequality has risen. The increase in labour income inequality began earlier than the post-2000 slowdown in productivity. It is, for example, evident in below-average growth of the labour income of the median worker, i.e. the worker at the midpoint of the distribution.</p>
          <p id="IDb4edaa12-7acd-4792-8bae-0d4b713ca310" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The combined effect of the productivity slowdown and the rise in inequality has been a decline in income growth to very low rates for many workers. Labour incomes of the majority of workers have continued to grow, and thus people’s well-being, in particular aspects relating to income and consumption, should have improved. But these rates of improvement have no longer been as strong as in the past, and they may have been lower than what people expected. Disparities in other well-being dimensions, such as health, education or employment opportunities, are also large (OECD, 2016a).</p>
          <p id="IDb39eb1dc-bfc7-480d-8016-83c2b82dfcb4" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A simple calculation illustrates how the productivity slowdown, the low growth of labour income relative to productivity and the rise in labour income inequality have pulled down labour income growth. Analysing the period 1990-2013 for 23 OECD countries, productivity grew by 3.1% per year during 1990-2000 and 0.9% during 2000-13.<fnote id="IDd9e49ab8-9f5a-48e3-8edb-9b4da65b1bf8"><p id="ID02323bfb-e50f-48d0-a2ae-5efd69dd19d9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">These growth rates are somewhat different to those in <xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDcb04ed55-5e3b-4366-82fb-1db385d37b15"/>, mainly because the country coverage for the present calculation is smaller.</p></fnote> Hence, if productivity had not slowed, the room for productivity-driven labour income growth would have been much larger. In addition, the growth rate of average labour income was 1.5%, one-fifth less than the average 1.8% productivity growth rate over the full period (Kappeler et al., 2016).</p>
          <p id="ID724d2f3a-7136-42cc-8c4f-d75d0c2786d0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Rising inequality has damped the labour income growth of many workers further. Labour income growth of the median worker was 1.3%, about one-tenth less than the 1.5% average labour income growth rate. Lower-income workers have fared even worse. Labour income of the median worker has grown less than productivity in 21 of 23 OECD countries (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID0a9a339f-f576-43e8-b9b4-62b09211e5e3"/>).

Studying market income, for which more comparable cross-country data are available, is thus quite similar to analysing labour income. Market income inequality has risen in line with labour income inequality. It is to some extent offset by redistribution through taxes and cash transfers. In other words, inequality in market income is higher than inequality in disposable income, i.e. income after taxes and transfers.</p>
          <p id="IDf071a373-afd5-4bde-be8f-7bb8056fc6e7" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The redistributive power of tax-and-transfer systems has been lower in the 2000s than the 1990s. Even though market income inequality has increased since 2000, the amount of redistribution has stayed the same. The rise in market income inequality has not been offset with additional redistribution through taxes and transfers. No change in redistribution since 2000 is the result of reduced redistribution before the crisis and higher redistribution since the crisis (OECD, 2015b). Tax-and-transfer systems may have been deployed less strongly to counteract market income inequality, or they may have become less effective at redistributing income. Such changes in inequality can be quantified with the Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality that scores 0 when everybody has the same income and 1 when all the income goes to only one person. The Gini for disposable income is about two-thirds of the Gini for market income.</p>

From 1990 to 2000, the Gini coefficient for market income increased substantially in this sample. The Gini coefficient for disposable income rose less, as taxes and transfers offset the increase in market income inequality in the 1990s somewhat more than in the past. From 2000 to 2011, the Gini coefficients for market and disposable income increased about the same, albeit much less than in the 1990s (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID4d6c1288-3000-4705-88b9-8745a75105e9"/>). Redistribution through taxes and transfers did not offset at all the rise of market income inequality in the 2000s. Overall, the redistributive power of tax-and-transfer systems in 2011 was about the same as pre-1990. The rise in the redistributive power of taxes and transfers during the 1990s was undone by the reduction in their redistributive power during the 2000s.<fnote id="ID56bbf50e-2a5a-4cf6-b331-a4ed8a679c88"><p id="ID7ee0a7ae-655f-4ed0-bd4d-452284fa246d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Redistribution is measured as the difference, in Gini points, between the Gini coefficient for market income and the Gini coefficient for disposable income.

When the Gini coefficients for market and disposable income are the same, i.e. when there is no redistribution, this measure takes on value 0.</p></fnote></p>

The analysis above shows that pay has grown faster for the mean than the median worker. Has inequality risen mainly around the middle of the distribution or at the extremes? Income growth rates at different points in the distribution can be examined for disposable income, the income concept probably most closely related to people’s well‑being.</p>

Differences in growth rates have been larger at the extremes of the distribution.

The top 10% households have seen their incomes rise at a higher rate than the bottom 10% households in every five-year period since 1990, including during the crisis years when real incomes of the bottom 10% shrank by 7%. Increases at the very top of the distribution, such as for the top 1%, have been even stronger, and may not be fully reflected in these statistics.</p>

Productivity growth during 2000-07 is estimated to have exceeded its trend by 0.3 percentage points per year on average. This pattern then reversed during 2007-15, when productivity growth averaged 0.2 percentage points less than trend. Thus, some of the productivity gains during the boom period were cyclical. One half of the productivity growth decline since 2007 is attributable to the cycle, the other half to a reduction in trend productivity growth (Ollivaud et al., 2016). These calculations come, as any such estimates, with some degree of uncertainty, given the unobservability of trend productivity.</p>

Capital rises with more investment in both tangible and less tangible forms of assets (machines and equipment, infrastructure, software, R&amp;D). TFP increases when better technologies or improvements in business products, processes and workplace practices raise the efficiency with which workers and machines are utilised. Capital per worker grew by 0.6% per year during 2000-07 and 0.3% during 2007-15. TFP growth declined from 0.7% before the crisis to 0.5% since the crisis (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5eeefbc0-e565-48b9-bf55-61774e2d7b95"/>, Panel B).</p>
          <p id="ID6c766532-e03b-45fe-80fa-51af7051ecfa" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The declining contribution of capital per worker to trend productivity growth over the post-crisis period reflects the persistent weakness of investment. Trend productivity removes cyclical variation from TFP and employment, but not from the capital stock. Investment fluctuates strongly with the cycle. The contribution of capital per worker has thus been smaller in the post-crisis period when the cyclical downturn brought investment down. Similarly, capital per worker contributed increasingly more to productivity growth during the boom before the crisis as investment rose in the upturn. Investment has lagged the recovery in GDP, especially in Europe (OECD, 2016b). Weak demand and growth prospects for the world economy, a slowdown in pro-competitive reforms and, in some markets, high costs of finance have been inhibiting investment (OECD, 2015c). Other recent analysis also suggests that the depletion of the capital stock in the United States has played a key role in propagating the shock of the financial crisis (Hall, 2016).</p>
          <p id="IDe8306c59-03ea-4da6-b435-e5f01e37c38d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In addition to weak aggregate demand, long-term structural factors have weighed on productivity growth. Business dynamism has declined, as is evident from the fall in business start-up rates and the slowdown in investment in knowledge-based capital (OECD, 2015a). Knowledge-based capital can, for example, take the form of R&amp;D, firm‑specific skills, organisational know-how, databases, design or intellectual property. In Europe, productivity growth has been weaker in industries that have recorded larger declines in the share of young firms (Andrews et al., 2016a).</p>
          <p id="IDe3bacfd2-5899-4443-a17d-5f7bb8f63ebc" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A disaggregation of firms by productivity shows that the productivity growth of the top firms, i.e. the most productive or innovative ones, has been more robust than that of non‑frontier firms. Based on industry-level data for 15 OECD countries, the productivity of industries in countries where the industry has the highest productivity level has grown at a similar speed in the 2000s as before. By contrast, productivity of non-frontier industries has slowed markedly. Andrews et al. (2015, 2016b) come to a similar conclusion when using firm-level data for 24 OECD countries. Productivity of the most productive firms in their sector worldwide has risen since 2001 at more than four times the speed compared with other firms (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID33bb0fac-722f-4352-96af-a515fa048ec7"/>). Preliminary results show that the crisis seems to have had a negative impact on the frontier firms, slowing down their productivity. Still, non-frontier firms appear to have experienced even lower productivity growth, thereby leading to a growing gap between the two groups.</p>

Declining growth rates of firms away from the global productivity frontier may be attributable to several, possibly complementary, factors (OECD, 2016a): Diffusion of technology and knowledge from frontier firms to others may have declined; poorly‑performing firms may remain longer in the market, rather than exit, thereby trapping resources in unproductive activities; high-skilled workers may sort into the same firms to a greater extent than in the past; and a rise in the concentration of market power and rent-seeking by frontier firms may have left non-frontier firms behind.</p>
          <p id="ID4c34b675-ffe2-4726-9990-43f52675a131" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Evidence on the third possible structural factor for the productivity slowdown, misallocation of capital, is comparatively less solid to date and warrants further research, including through more cross-country evidence. Several studies suggest that misallocation of capital has been particularly pertinent for the euro area. Following the introduction of the euro, countries in the periphery experienced large capital inflows and low productivity growth (Gopinath et al., 2015). Detailed analyses of Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain indicate that capital has been allocated to low-productivity firms (Calligaris, 2015; Dias et al., 2015; Gamberoni et al., 2016; García-Santana et al., 2016).</p>
          <p id="IDc90487bb-fdbb-42bd-820f-2a581c77a0f1" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">This misallocation of capital may have resulted in lower productivity growth also after the crisis. The slowdown of the capital stock since the crisis has been sharpest in OECD countries, which had the lowest interest rates before the crisis and may have over-accumulated capital (Ollivaud et al., 2016). Further, in some countries, the industries that are the main sources of productivity growth are no longer the same, suggesting misallocation across industries before and after the crisis. In the United Kingdom, for example, the contribution of financial services to productivity growth was strong and positive before the crisis, likely reflecting excessive leverage, but it has been negative since the crisis (Kierzenkowski et al., 2016).</p>

The fall in employment, not relative wage developments, was the main factor behind the rise in inequality of both market and disposable income. In fact, income poverty also increased after the crisis (OECD, 2015b). Disposable income inequality rose less than market income inequality, as more redistribution, in part due to automatic stabilisers, offset some of the income losses of households at the lower end of the distribution. The increase in redistribution during the crisis reversed the decline observed earlier in the decade so that the overall amount in 2011 was about the same as in 2000. As a result, inequality in market and disposable incomes increased by very similar magnitudes between 2000 and 2011 (as shown in <xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID4d6c1288-3000-4705-88b9-8745a75105e9"/>).</p>
          <p id="ID1385c685-ce5c-4ff6-90df-5f13fb76e63c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Several factors have contributed to the long-term rise in inequality. Inequality in the distribution of labour income has accounted for most of the increase in income inequality. To a certain extent, the increase in labour income inequality is likely related to technological progress, which may itself have been driven by investment in R&amp;D and innovation. Technical advancements may have benefited high-skilled workers more; for instance, earnings gains have been particularly large for people with much-demanded skills to deal with new information and communication technologies. In addition, a growing share of non-standard labour contracts and a lower coverage of collective bargaining in some countries may have further curbed the wage growth of low- and medium-skilled workers (OECD, 2011). These trends might have been compounded by globalisation and increased interconnectedness, for example through the integration of China in international trade flows (Autor et al., 2013, 2014).</p>
          <p id="IDf45fff4b-e494-4641-8990-07f9b7b54585" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">At least in some countries, the rise of labour income inequality has been primarily due to a rise in wage differences between firms, not within firms. This has been shown to be the case in Germany (Card et al., 2013), Sweden (Håkanson et al., 2015) and the United States (Song et al., 2015). According to this research, inequality has risen because some firms now pay all their employees much more than other firms, not because top managers have increasingly been paid more than support staff. The results in these studies indicate that some of the wage divergence between firms may be related to so-called assortative matching, whereby high-wage workers and high-wage firms increasingly <shortcitation>match</shortcitation> with each other.</p>

When advanced countries are compared with one another, dispersion of firm productivity is highly positively correlated with dispersion of labour income across firms (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5d8fa23e-09e2-4a2f-a986-42e0c66a9dc9"/>).<fnote id="IDb8cbe129-eebb-4bc7-a278-02532b672544"><p id="ID32069c1b-2bd9-45fb-b9bf-32b8d9a2d7d5" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Regressing the P90/P50 ratio in the firm distribution of average labour income on the P90/P50 ratio in the firm distribution of labour productivity yields a coefficient estimate of 0.47 and a p-value of 0.0001. The R-squared is 0.58, and the number of observations is 21.</p></fnote> This finding is not predicated on the economic conditions since the global financial crisis, as conclusions are the same with pre- and post-crisis data. Further, alternative firm-level data sources, such as the OECD MultiProd database (OECD, 2016a), yield similar results. Hence, a conjecture (consistent with the evidence to date, although without conclusive proof of causality) is that the productivity divergence across firms has resulted in an increase in labour income inequality.</p>

Rising inequality in wealth and capital income, which are already more concentrated than labour income, is likely to have increased total incomes at the top. Other factors that may have contributed to the strong rise of top incomes are reductions in top marginal income tax rates and stronger protection of rents. In the United States, for example, corporate profits in the technology and financial industries are close to record highs and many industries have become more concentrated. This growing market power may have benefited employees in high-wage firms the most. Further analysis of the sources of top income inequality is an important area of future research.</p>

Many policy choices – on monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural policies – affect both productivity and inequality. They could therefore act as levers to tackle the productivity slowdown and the rise in inequality together, or may sometimes involve trade-offs. This part discusses measures in four areas: policies to support aggregate demand; public spending and tax policies; competition and innovation policies; and financial market policies.</p>

Policies that strengthen aggregate demand, in particular through stronger investment, may therefore increase productivity, employment and household income. Monetary and fiscal policies support demand most directly. Structural reforms improve economic growth prospects in the long term and, with appropriate choices, can also support aggregate demand in the short term.</p>
          <p id="ID47d20478-00a6-4455-8ef0-29611c62c460" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Monetary, fiscal and structural policies must be deployed in a consistent and synergistic manner. None of the three levers can work alone. Experience to date suggests that the strong reliance on monetary policy has been insufficient to deliver satisfactory growth. With monetary policy close to its limits, fiscal policy is important to generate demand, and structural reforms can facilitate the necessary reallocation of resources.</p>
          <p id="IDbfea0937-614c-4a14-a05d-761bd03451fc" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Monetary and fiscal policy options to support demand vary across economies (Chapters 1 and 3). In several economies, the macro policy mix, which needs to remain accommodative, would benefit from the enhanced use of fiscal policies, given growing concerns about the potential distortions caused by non-conventional monetary policy actions and diminishing returns of further easing. The very low interest rates for government borrowing have in effect increased fiscal space, providing many countries with room for expansion. Collective fiscal action, that lets countries mutually benefit from the positive spillovers of fiscal actions in other countries, would raise the pay-off for individual countries from undertaking fiscal expansion and is consistent with fiscal sustainability.</p>
          <p id="IDe1746faf-86f6-4e9e-bb04-7b1339856012" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The effects of such aggregate demand policies on income inequality have a cyclical and structural dimension. The current situation of inadequate aggregate demand, where many economies operate at less than potential output, is synonymous with low employment rates. Low employment rates are an important source of poverty and income disparities, because they generate no labour income for an unusually large number of workers. As emphasised above, the decline in employment over the cyclical downturn since the global financial crisis has increased poverty and income inequality.<fnote id="ID0cd4a21e-3321-42fe-8b4d-8be638c5e639"><p id="ID4c8db945-9650-4aa0-972a-10a719523369" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Effects from the very expansionary stance of monetary policy on income inequality via financial channels are likely to have been small (O’Farrell et al., 2016).</p></fnote></p>
          <p id="ID35753f6a-aaf7-4c17-b088-128448f564c8" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Macroeconomic expansion to further stimulate aggregate demand would be suited to reduce this cyclical effect of a temporary rise in poverty and income inequality. Demand management in today’s economic environment can have the additional benefit of countering increases in income inequality even over the longer term. Continued economic weakness may damage the employability of workers who have been out of work for too long. Long-term unemployment erodes the skills of workers and their earnings prospects and could thus result in permanently higher inequality.</p>
          <p id="ID06a5de86-604a-4435-9059-7efa308e7f97" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A very powerful fiscal tool to raise demand, productivity and income would be to increase public investment. Public investment has fallen as a share of GDP compared with pre-crisis levels at the aggregate OECD level (Ollivaud et al., 2016). Multiplier estimates are usually larger for investment than other spending components (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012; Ilzetzki et al., 2013). Infrastructure is often perceived to be deficient, and many governments are now able to borrow at very low interest rates for long maturities. Public investment can be particularly effective when it catalyses private investment (OECD, 2015c). More investment would have the twin benefit of not only expanding demand today, but also supply tomorrow, by adding to the capital stock. Evidence in the next section on the structural composition of public spending suggests that higher levels of public investment should be maintained, even when monetary policy eventually gains more traction again and the global economy gets back to potential. Insofar as reductions in public expenditure are needed in the long term to preserve fiscal sustainability, they should be sought in areas other than investment.</p>

Size, composition and design of spending and taxes may influence productivity growth and the distribution of income. As the first part of this chapter showed, the redistributive power of taxes and cash transfers, an important component of public spending, has been less in the 2000s than the 1990s. This section studies the long-term effects of government effectiveness and size, the composition of public spending and specific taxes on productivity and inequality.</p>

Further, a larger overall size of government, measured as higher spending or taxes, has had no statistically significant effect on growth in countries with effective governments, although it has on average raised productivity. Larger governments have reduced growth and productivity in countries with ineffective governments. Increasing the size of government has been associated with lower income inequality in countries with effective and ineffective governments. These estimated relationships are derived on average from the historically observed levels of government effectiveness and size; they should not be extrapolated to overly high or low values (Fournier and Johansson, 2016).</p>

Better and more education is associated with higher growth and productivity, and also greater income equality, when years of schooling count only time in primary and secondary education, not tertiary education.<fnote id="ID943a5465-b55e-4939-8bff-3d283a2e95b0"><p id="IDc29a1333-082b-4f28-81b6-7f44185257fd" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The analysis uses a quality-adjusted measure of the level of education, instead of education spending which can take long to translate in better educational achievement. In particular, the average number of years of schooling of the working-age population is interacted with the country’s score in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).</p></fnote> This is in line with evidence that investing in early childhood education yields high returns since it enhances equality of opportunity and skill acquisition throughout life (Wößmann, 2008; Cuhna et al., 2010; Heckman, 2011; Cingano, 2014; OECD, 2015b). The empirical links of better and more education with higher growth, productivity and equality suggest long-term benefits from a greater share of education in public spending.</p>
            <p id="IDb451b750-ed15-4769-bff5-5abb1893f7b6" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Governments allocating a larger share of total expenditure to good-quality public investment tend to boost growth and productivity over the long term in the average advanced country (Fournier, 2016). Higher public investment raises disposable incomes of households across the distribution, leaving income inequality broadly unchanged. Illustrative simulations similar to those in Fournier and Johansson (2016) have been conducted, wherein public investment in countries with public investment relative to trend GDP below the average ratio of that of countries in the top half converges to this average ratio over ten years. Households in many countries could experience income gains, of up to 15%, from a shift in spending towards public investment (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDcafc298d-69d9-4a60-b117-ada0f660c5ec"/>). Differences between low- and high-income households are small and far from statistical significance.</p>

They should thus receive priority in government budgetary plans. Two other spending items, social spending on family and child care and public subsidies, appear to reduce income inequality. Family benefits tend to target lower-income households, and more child care may facilitate access to the labour market especially for lower-income households with children. Some subsidies may be used to redistribute, lowering income inequality. Subsidies are, however, negatively related with economic growth, although they do not appear to be associated with lower productivity. No statistically significant effects have been identified for other areas of public spending, for example health.</p>

Reducing statutory corporate income tax rates tends to raise productivity (Schwellnus and Arnold, 2008; Vartia, 2008). High corporate income taxes may reduce incentives to invest in innovative activities by lowering their after-tax returns. Further, corporate income taxes favour debt over equity when only interest payments, and not the notional costs of equity finance, are tax deductible, as is the practice in most advanced countries. This may discriminate against industries, such as knowledge-based industries, that rely more on equity. The effect of lower corporate income taxes on inequality is less clear, which can limit their attractiveness, despite the likely productivity gains. Inequality may rise, because of the concentration of holdings of corporate shares. But lower corporate income taxes may also increase employment, which could reduce inequality.</p>
            <p id="IDcd17cd24-0a0a-48e2-b671-5c4d63892c5d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Other tax instruments that are related to incentives for innovation include top personal income tax rates and R&amp;D tax credits. Higher top personal income tax rates have been associated with lower long-run productivity (Vartia, 2008), possibly because they reduce the post-tax returns for successful entrepreneurs. R&amp;D tax credits boost R&amp;D spending (Westmore, 2014), which may, as some evidence indicates (Égert, 2016), increase productivity. As the next section shows, such fiscal incentives for R&amp;D tend to be broadly neutral with respect to income inequality. Some countries have introduced preferential taxes on intellectual activities (<shortcitation>IP boxes</shortcitation>) to encourage investment in knowledge-based capital. However, concerns have been raised about their efficacy in encouraging new innovation and the degree to which they encourage profit shifting (OECD, 2015d; IMF, 2016).</p>

These structural reforms have improved resource allocation and the prospects for economic growth. Their benefits may be due to higher productivity, higher employment or both, and they might, or might not, be evenly spread across income groups. This section highlights reforms that are likely to promote productivity and examines their effects on income inequality.</p>

Evidence on this beneficial effect of product market reforms comes from several cross-country sources: the macro-level analysis of Égert (2016), the industry-level analysis of Cette et al. (2016) and the firm-level analysis of Andrews et al. (2015). Égert (2016) uses annual data over a long time horizon on the extent of regulation in three network industries: energy (electricity and gas), transport (air, rail and road) and communication (telecom and post). The indicator combines information on entry barriers, public ownership and other aspects of regulation. Reducing the stringency of network industry regulation is estimated to raise both labour productivity and TFP in a statistically significant manner. Andrews et al. (2015) reach a similar conclusion for overall product market regulation, not only the regulation of network industries. Product market reforms also increase employment (Gal and Theising, 2015).</p>
            <p id="ID5cb287b1-59ac-4d70-b58b-d38bea58d6de" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Product market reforms are inclusive in that they lift the disposable income of households across the distribution. Income equality remains broadly unchanged. Causa et al. (2016) nest the macroeconomic estimate of Égert (2016) in an empirical framework that estimates how product market reforms translate into income gains for households at different points in the distribution. Their analysis shows that the disposable income of households across the distribution increases when the regulation of network industries is eased (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID7e795418-7c3c-45aa-8c01-1136b0ea4324"/>). Wage disparity rises, but so does employment. The effects are statistically significant across the distribution and not significantly different for low- and high-income households. Andrews et al. (2015) conclude that product market liberalisations leave the productivity distribution of firms broadly the same. This suggests too that income inequality may not change much, insofar as productivity and wage dispersion move together.</p>

Greater market power may lead to higher rents and allow companies to block new competitors from entering the market. Furman and Orszag (2015) argue that some firms, such as in the technology sector or finance, benefit from consistently high supernormal profits and share these with workers through wage premiums. To a certain extent, such winner-takes-all phenomena can be efficient due to the way technologically-advanced services benefit from a large user base. In other cases, however, anti-competitive actions by firms (such as mergers and acquisitions) may have exacerbated market power. Robust enforcement of the competition regime, combined with a reduction in regulatory barriers to entry and exit, can thus improve efficiency and equality. Competition regimes may also have to be reviewed and adapted to new technologies. Furthermore, in areas, such as intellectual property rights protection, copyright systems or R&amp;D support, well-intentioned policies designed to boost innovation efforts may inadvertently give an edge to incumbents at the expense of innovative start-ups (Bravo-Biosca et al., 2014).</p>

Égert (2016) and Causa et al. (2016) approximate innovation with private and public R&amp;D expenditure (per cent of GDP) and the number of patent applications (per capita). These measures may be interpreted as capturing the effects of policies that increase incentives for R&amp;D spending and patent applications. When R&amp;D spending or patent applications increase, labour productivity and TFP rise in a statistically significant manner. In line with these results, stronger patent rights protection has been found to raise productivity (Bouis et al., 2011).</p>
            <p id="ID359dbc34-77f5-49f1-a116-5ca7a10f4801" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Empirical evidence suggests that, like product market reforms, higher R&amp;D spending is inclusive in that it is associated with higher disposable income for households across the distribution. Income gains from innovation activities reflected in the number of patent applications are more unequally distributed, as the income of households in the lower half of the distribution does not increase. This finding may be due to technological advancements primarily benefiting high-skilled workers. However, the magnitude of the differences in the effects on households is small, so that policy changes also in this area are unlikely to lead to a notable rise in income inequality. Related studies that not only focus on inequality of income but also of opportunity indicate that innovativeness is positively correlated with social mobility. As innovativeness in an economy rises, children become more likely to be either higher up or lower down in the income distribution than their parents (Aghion et al., 2015, 2016).</p>
            <p id="IDc5ce5696-c9e1-4f00-8fce-5f99441db1a9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Innovation policies that reduce productivity dispersion across firms may diminish labour income inequality. Results from firm-level micro data suggest that more R&amp;D collaboration between universities and firms reduces the productivity gap between the less productive and most productive firms (Andrews et al., 2015). This may be because R&amp;D collaboration with universities facilitates technological diffusion by providing smaller firms with access to sources of knowledge, such as advanced machinery or skilled scientists. Thus, initiatives to encourage R&amp;D collaboration between universities and firms bear the promise of both raising productivity and equality.</p>

A better matching of jobs and skills is likely to improve the allocation of labour across firms. Adalet McGowan and Andrews (2015) find that skill mismatch is associated with more stringent framework policies (product market regulation, cost of closing a business) and mobility-restricting housing policies (transaction costs, rent control, responsiveness of housing supply). Reforms in these areas can facilitate the reallocation of workers who are over-skilled for their jobs to new jobs that better match their skills. This reallocation lifts workers’ productivity at the new firm and leads to higher wages. It is unlikely to make other workers worse off. The influence of such worker reallocation on income inequality depends on the location of over-skilled workers in the income distribution. Some evidence indicates that over-skilling may be particularly common in some high-income industries, such as finance and information and communication (Cazenave-Lacroutz, 2014).</p>

Studies using both firm- and industry-level data provide evidence in support of this (Bassanini et al., 2009; Andrews et al., 2015). Recent research based on aggregate cross-country time‑series data finds mixed results for the productivity effect of employment protection regulations (Égert, 2016). Easing of employment protection may benefit efficient firms, which at least initially could widen productivity differentials between firms and wage differentials between workers (Andrews et al., 2015). Such a reform might increase inequality (OECD, 2011), possibly by further depressing the income of lower-income households (Causa et al., 2016). On the other hand, easing of dismissal costs tends to reduce labour market duality by aligning the stringency of employment protection between standard and non-standard work (Boeri, 2011). While effects of duality are difficult to identify in cross-country data, studies focusing on specific countries tend to show that reducing duality can improve productivity and lower inequality, by allowing more workers to get a foothold in stable jobs and increasing their commitment.</p>

Labour market policies, for example, can interact with other policies, such as product market policies, and influence the productivity benefits from reforming product markets. Product market reforms often enhance economic flexibility. Labour market policies can facilitate the reallocation of workers, which would help reap the benefits from more flexible product markets.</p>

Which income groups are affected by the increased labour market churn that comes with product market reforms? Low-income workers have a higher probability than other income groups of leaving employment (Cournède et al., 2016a; Garda, 2016).

This effect of enhanced economic flexibility suggests accompanying product market reforms with active labour market programmes (ALMPs) to help individuals transition to new jobs (Cournède et al., 2016b). ALMPs tend to benefit workers in the lower half of the income distribution (Causa et al., 2016). The combination of product market reforms and effective ALMPs can therefore raise productivity and household income, while lowering income inequality. Complementary evidence on mass lay-offs underlines that ALMPs also improve re-employment prospects of displaced workers (Andrews and Saia, 2016).</p>

For instance, implementing regulatory reforms in product and labour markets jointly may be better than a <shortcitation>one-sided</shortcitation> reform (Égert, 2016). The effectiveness of policies is also likely to depend on the economic environment in the country. An example is higher R&amp;D spending, where favourable effects on productivity increase with a stronger rule of law, market settings more conducive to business start-ups and growth and lower barriers to trade. Estimating empirically the inequality effects of such policy complementarities is an important area for future research.</p>

But finance is also likely to have contributed to the initial shortfall in aggregate demand and the current weakness in investment. Excessive leverage has been stifling household consumption, and credit supply constraints may have exacerbated the investment slowdown. Write-downs of non-performing loans and faster bank recapitalisations would help households deleverage and facilitate the provision of new credit, which is particularly important for the euro area. For some European countries, inefficient insolvency regimes have been identified as a barrier to addressing the rise in non-performing loans (Bergthaler et al., 2015). In the United States, high household debt levels were an important source of the contraction in consumption (Mian and Sufi, 2014).</p>
          <p id="ID2a884025-ef88-48ff-877e-c2001bda4fdb" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">One finance-related factor which is likely to hold back long-term productivity growth is that many banks and similar financial institutions benefit from too-big-to-fail (TBTF) guarantees by governments and central banks, despite new regulatory measures in Basel III. TBTF reflects the perception by the holders of bank debt and, to some extent, bank equity that their investments are protected. One way such TBTF guarantees may have found their way into the real economy is the rapid pre-crisis rise of bank credit.</p>
          <p id="IDe4308a68-3006-4323-9808-6e9315fe780e" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Empirical evidence supports this conjecture. Data from the past 50 years show that above-trend credit expansions have led to a slowdown in GDP per capita, and that the effect is particularly strong in countries where TBTF is larger (Cournède and Denk, 2015; Denk et al., 2015). By contrast, a stronger reliance on stock markets has been associated with higher economic growth (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID1ebbc4ec-2055-48df-aa49-44f324f00c90"/>, Panel A).

          <p id="ID4a3acd78-2b92-4aa1-ba34-bba26a6cb85c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Credit overexpansion may be particularly harmful by inducing labour reallocations to industries with lower productivity growth (Borio et al., 2015). It may also exacerbate misallocation of capital, for example through too much lending to households (Turner, 2015). More recently, credit has expanded very rapidly in several emerging market economies, including China and Turkey. The positive productivity effect of higher equity finance concurs with the finding that countries with better developed venture capital markets are more effective at channelling resources to young innovative firms (Andrews and Criscuolo, 2013).</p>
          <p id="IDc3e2baf8-eeb7-40d3-9ce2-e81b62f94ea0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The rise of finance is also linked with changes in income inequality (Denk and Cournède, 2015). More bank credit and larger stock markets are both correlated with a less equal distribution of household disposable income, when accounting for many other factors (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID1ebbc4ec-2055-48df-aa49-44f324f00c90"/>, Panel B).</p>

In Europe, the financial sector wage premium (or how much financial employees receive in excess of what similar workers are paid in other industries) is 25% of average earnings (Denk, 2015a). It rises across the earnings distribution, reaching nearly 40% for top-paid workers (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID77dd8ed4-9cab-4f71-a3aa-be3501adf8d1"/>). High wage premiums are one reason why finance is the industry most disproportionately represented among the top 1% earners (Denk, 2015b). Such financial rents raise inequality and, as a symptom of excessive returns to the conduct of banking activities, they are likely to reduce productivity as well, not least considering the importance of banking services as inputs for other industries. Restricting compensation practices that reward short-term success with no claw-back provisions would cap very high financial sector pay when it is the most unjustified.</p>

One avenue would be to break up TBTF banks into small entities which can go bankrupt without creating systemic risk. Alternative approaches would be, for example, to impose higher capital surcharges on TBTF banks or to force creditors to take losses more frequently in the case of insolvent banks (Cournède et al., 2015). In the short term, however, such measures can hurt economic activity.</p>

Solving the productivity-inequality twin challenge is essential to lift people’s income prospects from the very low rates of the past two to three decades. This requires coherent and comprehensive policy packages combining demand and structural policies. The chapter has outlined the key general lessons for the design of such policy packages. Reforms also need to take into account country-specific aspects of the institutional framework and policy settings currently in place. Even as each package deploys monetary and fiscal policy, and levers from each of the suite of structural policies (public spending and taxes, competition and innovation, financial system structure and performance), there is no one-size fits all.</p>
        <p id="ID6de28008-1448-4dad-855c-7633831fb560" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The primary focus of the chapter has been on advanced economies, for which the productivity slowdown has been most severe and the evidence base is the strongest. However, productivity growth has declined and income inequality is high in some emerging market economies, too. Gaps in productivity and income are large between advanced and emerging market economies. Many structural reform priorities are similar to those for advanced countries (OECD, 2016b). One distinguishing feature of emerging market economies are high rates of informality. These often trap low-skilled workers in informal, low-productivity firms and can thus contribute to low productivity and high inequality (Hsieh, 2015). In such cases, reforms that combine education, regulation, taxation and the rule of law can help (Dougherty and Escobar, 2013).</p>

Targeted R&amp;D policy, university-business linkages and effectiveness and efficiency of financial support for research are important. Ensuring strong competition, regulation that accommodates new internet-platform-based businesses, sound ICT infrastructure and continuing education reform are also key for productivity performance. In addition, education reform will boost inclusiveness through stronger low-end skills and better ICT infrastructure can reduce gaps in economic opportunity by improving access in rural areas.</emphasis>

In addition, house-price and mortgage-credit growth are slowing, assisted by macro-prudential tightening. Consumer price inflation remains low. Also, uncertainty about global economic prospects is impacting Australia’s stock market and business sentiment.</p>

Reform to the latter could lower inequality by narrowing differences across households and between women and men among older cohorts. Strengthening of consumer-protection regulation in banking would also benefit households. Australia’s greenhouse-gas reduction policy relies principally on the Emission Reduction Fund, which provides financial incentives for businesses to reduce emissions and as of July 2016 it will backed by a safeguard mechanism that discourages offsetting emissions. </p>

Investment growth resumed in 2015 but the investment rate remains considerably below historical average. Despite weak economic growth since 2011 and rising unemployment, inflation has been persistently higher than in other euro area countries. Falling labour productivity in services has raised intermediate costs which may have weakened international competitiveness and contributed to subdued export performance. Structural changes in regional value chains, in particular the relocation of supply chains from Austria to central and eastern European countries, may also partly explain losses in export market shares.</p>

The winding-down of failed banks is still not completed, but announced bail-in of senior creditors would be an important step towards containing expectations of implicit guarantees. The projection assumes that no additional capital transfers or subsidies to troubled banks will be necessary. Growth could be boosted further and become more inclusive by promoting a more gender-equal society with a tax-and-benefit system that encourages a more balanced distribution of work, the provision of more full-day schools and care centres, and more family-friendly workplaces and working-time models.</p>

Tackling rigidities in the services sector would improve productivity and provide better jobs in the sector. It may also help to preserve and extend employment in the tradable sector as participation in global and regional production chains increasingly depends on the provision of high-quality services. The integration of refugees into the labour market may temporarily weigh on average productivity but is of critical importance for the preservation of social cohesion, Austria's growth potential and its fiscal position.</p>

The current account surplus will continue to be supported by buoyant tourism. Some risks surround the projection. Overall export performance may be stronger than projected if lost market shares are regained or weaker if the slide in market shares continues amid subdued competitiveness and restructuring of regional value chains. The restructuring of the banking sector is ongoing which may continue to affect public finances. Associated uncertainties could weigh on confidence and hold back investment more than projected. On the upside, the tax reform could boost private consumption more if saving rates pick up less than expected. Second-round effects of the reform on employment and investment may also be stronger than anticipated. The projected rebound of investment could be hampered by weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area and emerging markets or substantial increases in oil prices.</p>

Stronger growth in main trading partners, in particular the United States and Europe, are supporting exports. High capacity utilisation rates and the decline of unit labour costs for the second consecutive year are feeding a slow rise of private investment, but a large one-off investment in the pharmaceuticals in 2015 has not been replaced. Low oil prices have boosted household spending, but the pace of consumption growth is slowing as the suspension of the automatic indexation of wages and social benefits and restrictions on collective wage bargaining bear down on real incomes. The terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have driven down private consumption growth during the first half of 2016. Inflation, the highest in the euro area, is trending up, mainly due to the increases of indirect taxes, in particular on electricity. </p>

Lower social security contributions for employers, and corporate tax deduction for productive investment in SMEs and for high tech investment, are expected to strengthen labour market performance and productivity growth. Higher tax relief for low wage workers can, by increasing take-home pay, enhance inclusiveness. However, more is needed to ensure equal educational and labour market opportunities, especially for migrants and the low-skilled, notably by reducing the concentration of disadvantaged students in particular schools, delaying tracking in secondary education, and expanding training offers and diversity plans in firms.</p>

Another rating downgrade occurred in December, and no major rating agency now considers Brazil’s sovereign debt to be investment grade. This deterioration is due to declining revenues in the face of the recession, and there may be further revenue shortfalls. The plan to unwind significant tax exemptions was not fully implemented, further weakening the fiscal position. Expenditures continue on an upward trend while spending efficiency remains low. Year-on-year inflation is slowly coming down as the recession reduces inflationary pressures and the strong increases in administrative prices in early 2015 are beginning to fall out of the 12-month window. Still, inflation remains well above the ceiling of the target range of 6.5%. </p>

Reducing the compliance costs and distortions imposed by Brazil’s fragmented system of indirect taxes would provide an almost immediate cost reduction for firms, and could be achieved by consolidating indirect taxes into a single, broad-based value-added tax with full deductibility for inputs and a zero-rating for exports. In addition, reducing barriers to international trade would reduce the costs of imported inputs and strengthen incentives to enhance productivity. Improvements in infrastructure could also reduce transport costs, particularly for exporters. Stronger trade integration would benefit low-income earners in particular, as an expansion of the export sector would have a larger impact on the demand for low-skilled labour. Further improvements in educational attainment would not only raise productivity, but also allow more low-income households to join Brazil’s growing middle class. </p>

Inflation will continue to decline due to weak activity, and the monetary authorities will be in a position to lower the monetary policy rate.

If uncertainty about future policies is resolved more rapidly than assumed and a consensus for reforms is achieved, confidence could improve rapidly and growth could even be positive in 2017. At the same time, the deep political divisions could also lead to further instability well into 2018, which would make it very difficult to pursue the economic policies needed to sustain growth. </p>

Additional downside risks could come from the corporate sector, where the effects of the ongoing recession are becoming increasingly visible. Bankruptcy filings are increasing across all company sizes and corporate defaults may rise going forward. Among publicly traded companies, net financial debt rose by 24% during 2015, at the same time as earnings declined by 29%, without counting the three large companies with public participation (Petrobras, Vale, Electrobras). Further currency depreciation could help exporters, but it could also imply difficulties for corporate borrowers, even if almost half of the corporate debt in foreign currency is hedged or backed by export revenues. A further slowdown of growth in China, the export destination for many of Brazil’s commodity exports, could also reduce growth in Brazil.</p>

Growth in non-commodity export-related industries has picked up to still higher rates, aided by the earlier fall in the Canadian dollar and the recovery in export markets, but industries most affected by commodity prices remain depressed. Business investment in the oil and gas sector continues to fall sharply – it is likely to be about 60% below its 2014 level in 2016 - but should be a smaller drag on growth thereafter. Other business investment is also weak but should pick up as capacity utilisation in many non-commodity exporting sectors is already high and credit conditions are easing. Growth in private consumption has been subdued, reflecting adjustment to the terms of trade losses since mid-2014 (amounting to about 3% of national income), but should get a boost from the new Canada Child Benefit. At the national level, housing starts are running at the higher end of demographic requirements and housing investment is robust, especially in British Columbia and Ontario, although it is declining in oil-producing provinces. The recent fires in Alberta have shut down some oil-sands production, depressing economic growth in the second quarter of 2016, but activity is likely to bounce back in the third quarter as production resumes.</p>

The general government deficit is projected to rise by 0.5% of GDP over 2015-17, to 2.2% of GDP. This increase mainly reflects 2016 federal budget measures to boost demand, notably infrastructure spending, which is a government priority. The new policy package also includes measures to redistribute income towards low- and middle-income families. The most important of these is the replacement of existing programmes to help families with children, some of which are not means tested, by the means-tested Canada Child Benefit. There is also a substantial increase in funding to improve conditions for Aboriginal peoples.</p>

Based on the Bank’s projection that economic slack will be taken up by the second half of 2017, the projection assumes that monetary stimulus will be gradually withdrawn starting in late 2016. Very low borrowing rates have encouraged household credit growth and underpinned rapidly rising housing prices, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, which together are a third of the Canadian housing market. In relation to household incomes, both house prices and household debt are high. Macro‑prudential measures have been strengthened recently but should be tightened further and targeted regionally. </p>

The drag from falling investment and employment in the resource sector should soon peak and then gradually fade away. Non-energy exports should lead the recovery as they continue to benefit from the lower Canadian dollar and strengthening export market growth. Business investment outside the resource sector should rise with a lag as sectoral capacity constraints become binding. Growth in housing investment, on the other hand, should weaken, as further supply comes onto the market and the boost from past interest rate cuts fades. With moderate growth in household incomes, private consumption should continue to grow steadily. The unemployment rate is projected to edge down to 6¾ per cent by late 2017, and, with gasoline prices and the exchange rate stable and excess capacity eliminated, the inflation rate could rise to around 2%, the midpoint of the Bank of Canada’s target range. </p>

If they were to be higher than assumed, this would limit cuts in energy-sector investment and employment, while further falls in prices would accentuate these cuts. Developments in emerging market economies, notably China, will have an important bearing on commodity prices and export demand. The main domestic downside risk is a disorderly housing market correction, particularly in the high-price Toronto and Vancouver markets. This would damp residential investment and private consumption, and could threaten financial stability. In addition, the rotation of economic activity from commodity-producing sectors to other sectors could be more protracted than expected. The main upside risk is that the US economic expansion could be stronger than projected, lifting demand for Canadian exports.</p>

To make inflation converge to the target, the central bank has appropriately raised its interest rate by 50 basis points, to 3.5%, in the last quarter of 2015, stating that further increases would be required, but at a slow pace. However, since inflation is already showing signs of decline and inflation expectations are well anchored, monetary policy should remain supportive given that economic slack is expected to rise in the next several months. Furthermore, fiscal consolidation measures, concentrated mostly on current expenditures and consistent with the fiscal rule, were recently announced in response to lower expected medium-term copper prices. As a result, there will be little support from this source.</p>

A credit line to enhance small-company financing, allowing insurance and pension funds to invest in infrastructure, and simplifying procedures for service exporters should all facilitate entrepreneurship and investment. However, measures to strengthen inclusivity by bridging skills mismatches in the labour market and to foster female and youth participation to reduce inequalities are still needed to expand opportunities for everyone to enjoy the benefits of greater prosperity. </p>

Weaker-than-projected demand from China and Latin America, or volatile global financial conditions, would reduce external demand. Growth could also be weakened if business confidence does not revive. On the upside, a recovery of the price of copper would boost confidence and investment, and increase government revenues. New measures to boost competition and productivity could improve the business climate more than assumed. Risks for inflation remain closely tied to the evolution of the exchange rate and oil prices. </p>

Financing costs have come down slightly, but are still high in real terms as producer prices keep falling. Continued easing will reduce costs further and provide sufficient liquidity amid capital outflows. Corporate profitability is recovering after a sharp fall in 2015, against the backdrop of more moderate producer price deflation. Leverage, especially in the state-owned sector, remains high. Debt-equity swaps may provide only temporary relief, and may also delay necessary adjustment, including the exit of unviable firms. Loans with past due payment have risen sharply, foreshadowing a surge in bad debt. Recent defaults are expected to instil greater market discipline and better credit risk pricing. Collateralisation of land operation rights will allow farmers to buy housing in small cities, where inventories are high, though for such cities to become attractive, they need to provide better public services and job opportunities.</p>

The People’s Bank of China started to publish a trade-weighted currency index at the end of 2015, and disclosed its weights. Notwithstanding the delay of further US interest rate hikes, capital outflows continued, leading to a contraction of foreign exchange reserves through February 2016 and putting pressure on the exchange rate. Expected renminbi depreciation has led the corporate sector to reduce its foreign liabilities and boost its foreign assets. Individuals will also likely diversify their asset holdings as the capital account opens up further. Continued expectations of depreciation could trigger additional outflows, exacerbating the pressure on the exchange rate.</p>

In terms of a broader and internationally more comparable definition of the budget, adding up all four budget accounts, this implies a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. Additional large-scale quasi-fiscal spending through policy banks, which will partly finance the 2016-18 grandiose infrastructure package, will further ensure that the growth target is met. Local government investment vehicles, which have fuelled the urbanisation boom but also the accumulation of illicit sub-national government debt, will have fast-track access to the enterprise bond market and to subsidised loans, which may lead to another potential round of bailouts. Conversion of the business tax into a value-added tax in the remaining service industries will support services growth and more specialisation in general through outsourcing, thereby enhancing overall efficiency. </p>

The structure of investment is tilted towards infrastructure and real estate, while excess capacity will continue to weigh on business capital spending. State-owned enterprise reform will focus on mergers and acquisitions as well as streamlining business operations, leaving exit as a last option. Investment is increasingly financed by public funds, crowding out the private sector and potentially leading to further misallocation of capital. Slow corporate profit growth and high leverage will constrain household income growth, holding back consumption growth. Gradual adjustment in the industrial sector is expected to lead to moderate producer price reflation. While the planned adjustment in the steel and coal sectors will not have a major labour market impact, creating enough jobs for new graduates that meet their expectations appears more of a challenge. </p>
          <p id="IDd83deaee-5704-4a72-bdd4-5dd586014355" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Greater-than-expected stimulus would result in stronger growth in the short term, though it would increase vulnerability over longer horizons. By the same token, faster-than-planned adjustment in the industrial sector would drag growth down, although that would improve the economy's resilience. Supply-side policies, including deleveraging and working off excess capacity, are crucial to avoid a sharp slowdown. Delayed adjustment continues to exert downward pressure on prices, which in turn hinders profit recovery and potentially increases future non-performing loans. In addition, the re-leveraging of local government investment vehicles could augment future government debt due to the assumed implicit guarantees and bailout. A further rebound in commodity prices could ease downward price pressure in upstream industries and help profit recovery in some industries. </p>

With real interest rates in negative territory, monetary policy remains appropriately accommodative, but is assumed to cautiously move to a more neutral stance to bring inflation expectations back into line with the target of the central bank. Financial soundness indicators have been strong and the exposure of the financial system to the oil sector is very low. Due to the fall of oil revenues, the government announced a reduction of public expenditure to comply with the fiscal rule in 2016. The cuts are appropriately well‑targeted to smooth the social impact. However, in the medium term, a comprehensive tax reform is needed to raise more revenue, given the need to accommodate public finances to the seemingly permanently lower commodity prices, and make growth more inclusive. </p>

The authorities have proposed a plan to start gradual fiscal adjustment this year, which is under discussion in the parliament. The package of tax reform and stricter expenditure control, if legislated and implemented, would cut the deficit by about 2% of GDP during 2016-17. However, additional fiscal adjustment of 1% of GDP will be needed to put debt on a firm downward path. Steps towards this include the recent legislative proposals to reform public employment conditions, thus preventing excessive automatic increases in current outlays, and further tax reform to increase revenues and reduce Costa Rica’s high inequality. </p>

Costa Rica is an energy importer, so global energy prices are important for growth and incomes. Global market volatility, deeper-than-expected slowdowns in advanced and emerging market economies and currency depreciation, could create problems for the stability of the banking system given its high credit dollarisation. On the domestic front, persistently large fiscal deficits and rising public debt make the economy vulnerable to sudden changes in financial market conditions. In addition, large government gross financing requirements could push up domestic interest rates, weighing on private investment and consumption, and limiting the transmission of the monetary stimulus to lending rates.</p>

The peg to the euro means that the policy rate is likely to remain negative and the interest rates are assumed to be low over the projection period. This may increase the risk of unsustainable increases in property prices. Before this risk materialises, fiscal and macro-prudential policies need to be stepped up to avoid a repeat of past boom and bust episodes. Fiscal policy has been accommodative overall. Low oil prices and declining oil production in the North Sea has weighed on government revenues, and are expected to continue to do so. Fiscal policy is expected to tighten only gradually, partly through a reduction in investment. However, this may be insufficient to contain emerging imbalances in the economy, particularly, given the already small degree of labour market slack. Further decreasing interest rate tax deductibility and regularly updating property valuations are the preferred forms of fiscal tightening in the medium term and would also establish tax neutrality across different asset classes.</p>

Investment should firm on the back of broad-based demand increases, higher capacity utilisation and low interest rates. Inflation is projected to rise gradually, as the spare capacity in the economy declines and commodity prices recover. </p>
          <p id="ID3502fef7-56cc-4fc8-93de-2988da332a8d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Continued trade weakness linked to a slowdown in emerging markets, in particular China, or disappointing growth in the euro area pose the main downside risks to exports. A potential Brexit could also hamper exports, as the United Kingdom is the fourth largest market for Danish exports. On the domestic side, stronger debt reduction among households would weaken domestic demand in the short term, but would provide room for stronger consumption and investment later on. The very supportive monetary policy stance, low energy prices and rising property prices could boost domestic demand further in the projection period. Likewise, recent labour market reforms could have a larger-than-expected effect on labour supply. </p>

Recorded employment has grown strongly, but this partly reflects stepped up requirements for employers to register informal workers. Unemployment has fallen, pushing up wage growth. Exports to Russia have dropped while growth of exports to other major trade partners, notably Finland, has remained modest. Transportation, storage and wholesale trade services have been particularly affected by the drop in trade with Russia. While cheaper oil has reduced import and consumer prices, it has weighed on the production of oil shale and oil shale products. Weak exports have held back business investment despite the favourable funding conditions. </p>

The increase in the minimum wage by 10% in both 2016 and 2017 will reduce in-work poverty and boost wages more generally, thereby encouraging Estonians to remain, rather than emigrate, and easing labour shortages. The reform of disability benefits in 2016 will also increase labour supply by introducing stricter assessments of work capacity and offering more counselling and training. The government also took measures to alleviate skill mismatch, such as extending the apprenticeship programme and strengthening capabilities to forecast the supply of, and demand for, skills. </p>

The impact on tax revenues will be partly offset by higher taxes on alcohol, tobacco and fuels.

Further escalation of the conflict in Ukraine could also undermine exports and investment. A further fall in oil prices would raise real household income but result in further downscaling of production in the oil shale industry. Although financial market turbulence in emerging market economies could spill over to Estonia, low debt levels, strong equity buffers in the banking sector and euro membership are likely to mitigate such risks.</p>

However, more support will be needed to move growth to a higher track. Some countries have room to provide additional fiscal support. In this context, well designed and chosen infrastructure investment is attractive in that it has a high short-term multiplier and lays the foundations for a more sustained expansion. In addition, tax and spending policy reforms can be growth and employment friendly. Decreasing labour taxation, especially for low earners, shifting the composition of expenditure towards investment, education and childcare, and increasing public spending efficiency would help to boost growth and make it more inclusive. Further efforts to strengthen national budgetary frameworks hold the promise of improving the quality of public finances. </p>

The very accommodative monetary conditions are assumed to persist over the projection horizon. To further spur credit growth and make it flow towards productive firms, faster resolution of non-performing loans is essential, and could be fostered by prudential tools and the setting up of asset management companies, possibly at the European level. To further reduce financial fragmentation and ease crisis management, a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and deposit insurance at the European level would be helpful.</p>

While innovation gives a temporary advantage to leading firms, enabling them to pay higher wages, the full gains from innovations are realised only when they are diffused through the market. Completing the Single Market in services and network sectors would spur investment by increasing competition and reducing regulatory burdens (in part by harmonising regulation). In turn, market integration would benefit from faster deployment of Trans-European transport and energy networks. Improving the availability and effectiveness of lifelong learning and job-related training would enhance knowledge diffusion and labour reallocation towards high-productivity firms. </p>

Monetary stimulus and cheap oil should continue to support private consumption and investment, and fiscal policy in the area as a whole will no longer be a brake on demand. Though gradually recovering, export growth will remain subdued throughout most of the projection horizon, and the large current account surplus will decline only slightly. Unemployment is projected to fall, but it will remain high in a number of countries. Due to cyclical slack and low inflation expectations, core inflation is projected to increase only slightly and remain well below 2%.</p>
          <p id="ID16ab0cb7-27d7-4ed3-bb2f-4469f57fe6fd" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union could significantly weaken growth across the euro area through higher risk premia, lower asset prices, and euro appreciation vis-à-vis the sterling. Financial turbulence in emerging market economies, induced by high corporate indebtedness or other vulnerabilities, would weaken demand for euro area exports and could also harm investment through higher interest rates. Lower-than-expected inflation would compound deleveraging challenges, but could boost real wages. Faster progress in cleaning up banks’ balance sheets and reforming product markets, spending and tax policies, in tandem with regained momentum in European integration, would boost GDP growth.</p>

Low inflation is lifting household real disposable income and consumption, although some policies to support consumption in 2015 have expired. Following a long slump, investment is starting to rise again. Low interest rates and migration into growth centres is raising residential construction, while large-scale projects are lifting business investment. Unemployment shows signs of stabilisation, albeit at a high level. The fiscal deficit is back under 3% of GDP, thanks to spending containment and increasing tax revenues.</p>

Hence, the extent and timing of the reforms remain uncertain. Fiscal consolidation efforts, assumed to be about half a percentage point of GDP per year, exert a drag on growth, even though spending cuts are partly offset by strategic expenditure on key government projects financed through balance-sheet transactions. However, expansionary euro area monetary policy and relatively easy access to credit are supporting growth. </p>

The investment recovery is broad-based and set to continue. Residential investment is fuelled by low interest rates and high demand in growth centres, while major commercial building projects are underway. Investment in machinery and equipment is rising, including for capacity expansion, as utilisation rates increase, notably in the forest and metal industries. Such investments will raise productivity, which has been lacklustre over recent years. Nevertheless, projected growth will be too weak to markedly reduce unemployment, even if policies enhance labour market flexibility. Inflation is set to remain subdued. The fiscal deficit will decline slowly, as consolidation measures are partly offset by rising ageing-related costs. </p>

Worsening geopolitical tensions, a further economic slowdown in China or increased volatility in emerging market economies and oil prices could disrupt the recovery. The ability of the government to implement its programme in the face of public resistance conditions medium-term growth and fiscal sustainability. In the short term, uncertainty over reform implementation and potential industrial action could weigh on the recovery.</p>

Following a 2014 reform the unemployed will receive rights to additional training hours. The envisaged reform to improve legal certainty regarding dismissals would make employers more willing to hire on open-ended contracts and this could improve chances to obtain more stable employment for low‑skilled workers, many of whom work currently on short-term contracts with poor access to training. That said, this would come at the cost of increasing risks to be dismissed for workers who already have an open-ended contract today. The cuts in social contributions mainly targeted at low-wage workers will also increase labour-market inclusiveness. However, as the measure is phased out as income rises, the associated increase in taxes could weaken incentives to participate in training and create low-wage traps. Further personal income tax cuts on low- and middle-income households, streamlined and more effective in-work benefits and additional reductions in employers’ social contributions will improve employment chances of low-wage workers, supporting consumption and making growth more inclusive. The recent product market reform should be extended to a wider range of regulated professions and retail regulation should be further eased, in order to expand job opportunities. </p>

Reforms to remove barriers to entry and competition in professional services and network industries would strengthen productivity and investment and could reduce the current account surplus. </emphasis>

Wages and employment rose, while low oil prices damped consumer prices, boosting private household consumption. Government employment has risen to deal with the needs of refugees. About 1 million refugees arrived in 2015 (1¼ per cent of the population). Most of them have not yet started looking for a job, as asylum procedures and first training measures are being completed. Unemployment remains at historical lows. However, close to one half of the unemployed have been looking for a job for more than a year, while at the same time skill shortages are contributing to rising vacancies. Barriers in the tax system and only limited full-day childcare and schooling hold back full-time female employment, restraining women’s careers and productivity.</p>

It is planning to ease legal barriers for asylum-seekers to look for a job. In view of the young age of many immigrants, such steps have a high long-term pay-off. </p>

Spending for child benefits, child tax allowances and long-term care benefits will rise by 0.2% of GDP. The child tax allowances have little impact on labour supply or poverty reduction, whereas the child benefit supplement for low-income children reduces poverty risk. Government investment spending for transport infrastructure, broadband networks, energy efficiency, housing, childcare facilities, universities and other research institutions will also increase by 0.2% of GDP. The supply of childcare facilities is progressing, helping to reconcile professional and family lives, but gaps remain, and most primary schools continue to provide teaching only in the morning. The federal government has also made higher transfers to local governments for investment and plans to create a long-distance road infrastructure corporation, to which it has assigned the revenues of road use charges. Most of the additional spending will make economic growth more inclusive. </p>

Strong domestic demand will push up consumer prices somewhat, as the impact of low oil prices fades and wages grow more strongly than productivity. Unemployment is expected to rise somewhat. World trade and investment in key trading partners are expected to remain subdued, damping exports. Moreover, the euro has appreciated and strong wage growth will reduce Germany’s competitiveness. Strong tax revenue growth and declining debt servicing costs are expected to keep the government budget in surplus, notwithstanding rising spending.</p>

Rising geopolitical tensions would affect the export-oriented German economy particularly strongly. An exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union would also increase uncertainty about trade and investment prospects. If they materialise, these risks would spill over to consumer confidence and financial markets. Lower oil prices would boost household consumption and business profitability but could also contribute to global financial market turbulence. The low leverage ratios in systemically important banks could aggravate the consequences of financial market turbulence. On the other hand, steps to implement reforms to complete the Single Market in the European Union and establish a comprehensive banking union in the Euro Area could boost exports and the attractiveness of Germany as a location to invest. Adopting policies to deal with domestic long-term challenges, notably with respect to population ageing and long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, could boost investment in the near term.</p>

The effectiveness of labour market training programmes should be enhanced together with measures to improve vocational training, work-family balance and lifelong learning. A comprehensive SME strategy could increase economic dynamism and inclusiveness.</emphasis>

A major factor was the slower disbursement of EU structural funds in the beginning of the new funding cycle, which has cut public investment. Business sector investment has also been lacklustre despite an increase in demand, still high business confidence and favourable credit conditions. On the other hand, private consumption has accelerated on the back of rising real incomes and the strength of consumer confidence. Exports in 2015 benefitted from past currency depreciation, but have slowed in line with the deceleration in export markets. </p>

However, in view of tightening cyclical conditions, such an expansion could increase economic tensions. In the first half of 2016, the central bank lowered again its policy rate twice, to 0.9% – a level that the bank judges to be in line with the medium-term achievement of its 3% inflation target, signalling an end to the policy rate cutting cycle.</p>

The funding for growth schemes, which provide liquidity to banks for SME lending, are being phased out during 2016 and replaced by the Market-Based Lending Scheme where the central bank will assume some of the interest rate risks for loans to SMEs, reduce supervisory risk weights on loans to SMEs, and provide credit data for better risk assessments. While support for SMEs may be helpful in raising economic dynamism, reduced risk weights may lead banks to take on too much risk. With both monetary policy and supervisory responsibilities, the central bank is in a position to monitor these trade-offs closely. </p>

Economic activity is projected to pick up during the course of the year and into 2017. Private consumption is set to expand strongly as real incomes are boosted by higher employment, lower personal income taxes, lower VAT rates on selected products, and a new family housing programme. Exporters are expected to continue to gain market shares, which will raise the current account surplus further. Sustained private employment growth and public work schemes will continue to drive down unemployment. Inflation is projected to edge up, despite the reduction in VAT rates, as the temporary effects of lower energy prices run their course and economic slack diminishes. </p>

Likewise, if the measures to advance infrastructure investment are more effective than envisaged, growth could be stronger in 2016. External risks are mostly negative. A weaker-than-projected recovery in world trade would hurt exports. Financial turmoil in Europe could force the central bank to tighten its policy rate earlier than assumed now. If temporary border controls recently put in place by several countries are maintained, this could hamper the free movement of goods and cross-border labour, hurting Hungarian workers and exporters.</p>

These pay rises are far above productivity growth, which remains subdued, and will affect competitiveness. Employment growth has also been robust, bringing the unemployment rate down to just 3.1%. The tourism boom has continued and is supporting construction. In addition, investment in a number of energy-intensive projects is boosting business fixed investment during 2016. </p>

The central bank needs to prevent a wage-price spiral emerging and establish monetary policy credibility if it is to achieve low and stable inflation.

However, wage increases remain particularly strong and the danger of a wage-price spiral is acute. In an election year it is imperative for macroeconomic policy to remain tight. Fiscal policy needs to resist calls for relaxation when the large windfall receipts from reaching agreements with bank resolution committees are received. </p>

Recent measures to improve monetary policy transmission should gradually be reflected in lower lending rates, supporting the economy. </p>

The large increase in public wages and pensions, recommended by the 7<sup>th</sup> Pay Commission, and the need to recapitalise banks and clean up balance sheets of states’ power distribution companies, are likely to put the public finances under strain. To finance much-needed social and physical infrastructure programmes, there is scope to raise more revenue from personal income and property taxes and to further rationalise subsidy programmes. Efforts to recognise stressed assets, to clean up banks’ balance sheets and to avoid a future build-up of bad loans are necessary for investment to revive, although they may have a negative impact in the short run. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code passed in May 2016, which replaces multiple laws dealing with insolvency and sets a time limit for the resolution of insolvency, is a welcome step.</p>

Such measures are urgently needed to boost productivity and employment in the manufacturing sector, which has remained under-developed compared to other emerging market economies. Meeting the aspirations of a rapidly growing working-age population, still largely rural, will also require training programmes and specific support to populations at risk.</p>

But to ensure the fiscal resources for critical policies needed for long-term growth, including a broader social safety net to ensure growth is widely spread, the government needs to step up efforts to improve tax collection. </p>

The combination of weak external demand and a high exchange rate hit exports, which had recovered somewhat at the end of 2015. Following the pattern of recent years, the main economic driver remains consumer spending, buoyed by increased employment and real wages, supported by higher minimum wages, and low interest rates. With easy access to credit, businesses increased their investmentin late 2015 and early 2016. Strong housing construction benefitted from government support. Unemployment remains low, at around 5¼ per cent, and prices continue to decline, under the impact of falling costs of imports and oil and cuts in VAT and some public tariffs. While confortable at 4½ per cent of GDP in 2015, the current account surplus declined at the beginning of 2016. </p>

As of 2017, however, it would be appropriate to resume the public debt reduction strategy. On a structural level, the steps taken to open the agricultural and food sector to imports and the banking sector to new competitors will generate benefits in terms of higher productivity and wages, and will help reduce the cost of living. Social cohesion, employment and productivity would also be encouraged by a better public transport network and improved training for underprivileged groups, currently poorly integrated into the labour market. </p>

Industrial production is trending up, with recent gains attributable to a large extent to capital and consumer durable goods. The increase in capital goods production and the trough reached in the construction sector indicate that investment may finally be turning around. However, bank credit supply constraints, along with uncertainty about future demand conditions, hinder a strong recovery of investment. The government is paving the way to create a secondary market for non-performing loans and improve banks' balance sheets, an important precondition to raise credit supply and investment. Sluggish external demand has been holding back export growth, while robust private consumption has been sustaining import growth.</p>

Delays in implementing the ambitious public investment programme and sufficiently cut public expenditure to avoid the hike in indirect taxes, for which Italy successfully invoked EU budget flexibility rules, would slow the recovery and worsen the fiscal position. The event of Brexit and renewed financial market turmoil in the euro area could raise risk spreads, and debt financing costs, requiring more fiscal restraint.

Nevertheless, labour shortages have risen to their highest levels in 25 years. Although the response of nominal wages to tightening labour market conditions has been weak thus far, real wages are rising, as consumer price inflation has fallen close to zero as a result of the drop in energy prices. The impact of household income gains on private consumption has been limited by a rise in the household saving rate from negative territory in 2013-14 to more than 1% in 2015.</p>

Investment is also supported by record high profits and by the cut in the corporate tax rate from 37% in FY 2013 to just under 30% in FY 2016. Consequently, corporate cash holdings have surpassed 60% of GDP. However, the 10% appreciation of the yen relative to the dollar in early 2016 and uncertainty about China’s growth prospects have weakened business confidence.</p>

The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is a major step and will help Japan shift to a more market-oriented agricultural sector. Additional free trade agreements currently under negotiation, such as Japan-EU and Japan-China-Korea, would also be beneficial. Another key to higher productivity is unlocking the corporate sector’s large cash holdings to boost investment and wages. The priority is to strengthen corporate governance by effective implementation of the recently-introduced Stewardship Code and Corporate Governance Code. Labour productivity also depends on developing the skills demanded in the labour market. Sustaining employment growth and promoting social cohesion require policies to narrow the large employment and wage gaps between men and women, which are among the highest in the OECD, by increasing the availability of affordable, high-quality childcare and promoting work-life balance. In addition, the tax and social contribution systems should be reformed to remove disincentives to work by second earners in households. Breaking down dualism would narrow wage inequality, which is a major cause of income inequality and relative poverty, and make growth more inclusive. </p>

The Bank continues to expand the monetary base by 80 trillion yen (16% of GDP) per year through its qualitative and quantitative easing. Nevertheless, headline consumer price inflation (excluding the tax hike), which peaked in mid-2014 at 1½ per cent (year-on-year), has remained close to zero since mid-2015, reflecting the decline in oil prices. Excluding food and energy, inflation has been nearly 1% in recent months. </p>

Depending on economic conditions, well-timed fiscal stimulus may be needed to mitigate the impact of the 2017 tax hike. However, even with the planned measures, Japan is not on track to achieve its target of a primary surplus (central and local governments) by FY 2020. A more detailed and concrete fiscal strategy should include measures to contain the growth of social spending and boost revenue through a gradual increase in the consumption tax rate, a broadening of the personal and corporate income tax bases and higher environmental taxes, which would also promote green growth. </p>

The quarterly growth pattern, though, is likely to be volatile due to the consumption tax hike. As in 2013-14, <shortcitation>rush demand</shortcitation> is expected to boost private consumption through the first quarter of 2017, followed by a decline after the tax hike. Weaker private consumption is projected to be partially offset by a pick-up in export growth as world trade rebounds, which will support business investment. Assuming broadly stable oil prices, headline inflation is projected to converge toward core inflation, reaching around 1% (excluding the tax hike) in 2017.</p>

The major uncertainty pertains to wages; while wage stagnation is a major downside risk, faster-than-expected gains would lead to stronger private consumption. External risks are largely on the downside, given uncertainty about China, which accounts for a quarter of Japanese exports. Continued yen appreciation would lower corporate profits and exports. Japan’s unprecedentedly high level of public debt is another key risk. Unless Japan implements a more detailed and concrete strategy to achieve its fiscal targets, it could face a loss of confidence in its fiscal sustainability, which in turn could destabilise the financial sector and the real economy, with large spillovers to the world economy. </p>

While the government has taken some fiscal measures, such as frontloading spending and extending a tax cut on cars, spending in 2016 is set to increase by only 0.4%, followed by 2.6% in 2017. Monetary policy is very supportive, but has been on hold since the Bank of Korea cut its policy interest rate in June 2015 to a record low 1.5%. With inflation continuing to undershoot the newly introduced inflation target of 2%, the projection assumes an additional interest rate cut. However, the central bank remains cautious, concerned that lower rates would further boost household debt even though the financial supervisor has moved to counter systemic risks to the financial system. </p>

In particular, a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China would be very detrimental to Korea. Global financial market turbulence in the context of diverging monetary policy stances and weakness in emerging market economies also pose downside risks. The planned restructuring of some major industries could lead to higher unemployment in the short run, while the upward trend in household debt could further constrain private consumption. On the upside, Korea’s strong external position provides a buffer against shocks and effective structural reforms could reignite domestic demand and reverse the decline in export performance. </p>

Exports suffered from the strong reduction of Russian demand and the hesitant recovery in the European Union. Manufacturing output has recovered. At the same time, labour market improvements came to a halt and the unemployment rate stagnated just below 10%. Unemployment is mainly structural and labour supply is held back by the combination of past emigration and population ageing. Consumer prices are falling because of the pass‑through of low oil and food prices. The current account is in a small surplus, mostly on account of the lower oil import bill and weak investment demand on one side, and the traditionally strong position of business service exports (including financial services) on the other side. </p>

Cross-border information exchange and strict monitoring of financial institutions with a significant share of non-EU customers is helping to maintain financial stability. Fiscal policy is broadly neutral. The government is committed to achieving budgetary targets and does not have much room to move. The Fiscal Discipline Law will help to reduce pro-cyclicality by establishing reserves to be accumulated in boom years.</p>

The informal sector is relatively large and the compliance with tax regulation is low. Measures to enhance competition are underway and an action plan is in place to reduce red tape. However, the implementation of governance reforms for state-owned enterprises has turned out to be cumbersome. The strong expansion of work-based learning should pay off by making vocational education school leavers more employable, reducing skills mismatches and improving social cohesion.</p>

Lithuania’s high poverty rate needs to be addressed through the expansion of in-work benefits to, in particular, the second earners of large families and social assistance recipients who are currently not eligible. To fund such obligations, improvements in tax compliance and in education and health spending efficiency are needed. There is also scope to increase some environmental taxation, such as levies on motor and heating fuels, which are currently among the lowest in the European Union. </p>

Many Lithuanian firms consider the workforce to be inadequately educated, highlighting the need for education reforms. Attracting higher-performing graduates to the teaching profession will be important, as will measures that promote participation in lifelong learning activities. Productivity convergence can also be accelerated by improvements in the performance of state-owned enterprises, which have a large presence in Lithuania. In particular, ensuring that the ownership and regulatory functions of these entities are not performed by the same government ministry and increasing the proportion of independent non-executive members on their boards is key to improving governance and, therefore, performance.</p>

Activity will be supported by very accommodative monetary conditions, domestic demand and gradually improving exports of services. A round of wage indexation could take place in the first half of 2017, and could boost inflation above the euro area average.</p>
          <p id="ID0c2966ee-02dd-4c7a-9c18-291a04dda471" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Given Luxembourg’s trade and financial linkages, much depends on the pace of the euro area recovery. High cross-border financial linkages between domestic banks, their groups’ foreign banks and investment funds could transmit external shocks into the domestic economy. On the other hand, should regional or global tensions reappear or rise, the solid reputation of the Luxembourg’s financial sector could result in larger capital inflows.</p>

Yet, the sharp depreciation of the peso has improved export competitiveness, with Mexican manufacturing exports gaining market share in the United States. Domestic demand has been the main driver of overall growth on the back of a strong expansion of credit as well as gains in real wages, services employment and foreign remittances. Notwithstanding the significant depreciation of the Mexican peso, inflation has remained below the central bank’s target, pushed down by supply factors such as the reductions in agriculture, electricity, gasoline and telecoms prices.</p>

To achieve its targeted deficit despite lower oil revenues, the government tightened its fiscal stance through a cut in spending of 0.7% of GDP for 2016, and plans to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement to 3% of GDP by 2017, mostly from reduced spending in PEMEX. These measures, if fully implemented, would ensure that the public debt ratio is put on a downward trajectory by 2017.</p>

Progress has already been made to open energy and telecoms to competition. These and further reforms should raise private-sector investment, improve efficiency and innovation, and upgrade the skills of low-educated workers. Measures to strengthen education, skills and financial inclusion will offer all Mexicans, but especially women, greater opportunities to contribute to society. A renewed push is essential to complete the reform process, and to make growth sustainable and inclusive.</p>

Another risk is a further degradation of market sentiment vis-à-vis emerging market economies. Conversely, should the US economy grow at a higher rate than projected, Mexican exports and foreign direct investment could grow faster. Inflation expectations for both 2016 and 2017 remain low, but second-round effects of past depreciations could raise the pass-through, in particular if they feed into wage growth, and increase inflation above the target. Inversely, further downward pressures on oil prices and difficulties in implementing cuts in PEMEX, in particular those related to current expenses, could delay reaching the budget deficit target and erode market confidence, although the government’s current fiscal projections for 2016 and 2017 were made using conservative assumptions for oil prices.</p>

Nevertheless, the structural deficit has moved further away from the Medium-Term Objective of 0.5% of GDP as a result of lower gas revenues, and offsetting measures over the medium term could be needed. Efforts to reform the tax system stalled in 2015, but should be revived to increase tax efficiency. Priorities should be to broaden the tax base by accelerating the reduction of mortgage interest rate relief and phasing out the lower VAT rate.</p>

Consumer prices are up only 0.4% year‑on‑year, weighed down by persistent declines in tradeables prices and weak non-tradeables inflation. Most estimates of underlying inflation are higher but still well below the official 2% target midpoint. </p>

These cuts have been aimed at pushing inflation back towards the 2% mid-point of the target range (which it projects to occur in the first quarter of 2018), partly assisted by a weaker exchange rate. They have, however, added pressure to the already hot housing market: prices increased by almost 11% over the past year, led by Auckland, where restrictive land-use rules prevent supply from keeping pace with demand. Macro‑prudential and other measures have been tightened further, including through Auckland-specific mortgage restrictions for the buy-to-let sector, tightening of capital gains tax rules and obligatory foreign buyer registration. Together, these changes have cooled the market somewhat. The government has maintained a rather tight fiscal stance. The budget has moved into a broadly balanced position (abstracting from financial gains and losses) in the current fiscal year and projects a small but growing surplus thereafter. </p>

The government is rightly focusing on targeted social investment to lift long-term outcomes and make growth more inclusive. It needs to do so by improving actions across the whole public sector in areas such as social housing, obesity and early childhood education. The government also significantly increased real welfare benefits earlier this year. </p>

The cyclical weakening is containing price pressures, notwithstanding pressures from imported inflation. House prices remain high relative to income, with widening regional disparities. Household debt is large and continues to rise. </p>

The 2016 budget relies more on consumption taxes, and less on income taxes. This change in the tax mix should help growth, but is also potentially regressive. A reduced VAT rate on restaurants will reduce revenues and will probably have little effect on employment. Planned reductions in corporate taxes, which could boost investment and growth, have been cancelled. An increase in social benefits will support low-income households. Projected spending reductions are subject to severe implementation risks. The public debt is still very high and, on the whole, current budget plans are insufficient to ensure it will decline. Although care needs to be taken not to derail the fragile economic recovery, it is possible that further fiscal measures will be required eventually, especially if productivity and, therefore, longer-term growth do not pick up. </p>

But the resulting increase in consumer spending is facing limits imposed by a historically low saving rate and slow job creation, leading private consumption to lose steam in 2017 as households increase their saving. Conversely, investment is projected to pick up during 2017, while improved competitiveness and recovering external demand will gradually strengthen exports. Taken together, these developments should support moderate growth over the projection period. The current account will continue to post a small surplus. </p>

A rating downgrade of Portugal’s sovereign debt could make access to external finance, including from the European Central Bank, more difficult. The banking sector remains constrained by weak profitability and a high share of non-performing loans, both of which raise concerns about financial stability. On the other hand, the successful implementation of recent policy initiatives aiming at reducing corporate debt and repairing banks’ balance sheets could reduce the vulnerability of banks and allow more resources to flow into new productive investment. </p>

Budget consolidation is set to resume, with annual structural balance adjustments of 0.5% of GDP in 2016 and 0.7% of GDP in 2017. This is appropriate, given robust economic growth and the medium-term challenges posed by rapid population ageing. Implementing multi-annual spending ceilings would help guide policy and, in particular, avoid overexpansion during a boom. In order to create fiscal room for manoeuvre and finance growth-friendly measures, the government should enhance public-sector efficiency. This should include effective implementation of the Value for Money initiative, which incorporates evidence-based analysis into policy making. </p>

Structural unemployment remains high, particularly among marginalised groups, such as the Roma. At the same time, companies in some sectors are increasingly experiencing skilled labour shortages as unemployment falls. Structural reforms that reduce skills mismatch in the labour market would quicken productivity growth. In particular, education reform could improve the skills of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, easing their access to jobs in high value added industries and making growth more inclusive.</p>

Given the still rising public debt, gradual fiscal consolidation based on permanent measures should continue. Structural reforms can help reduce pressures on public expenditure by boosting growth. Participation rates of younger workers can be raised by better active labour market policies. Pension reform, such as raising the retirement age, would help to counter the fiscal pressures from population ageing. Improved efficiency in public health and education could reduce costs without undermining quality of the service. Increasing the skills of workers from disadvantaged backgrounds and better targeting of active labour market policies to the long-term unemployed and the low-skilled would make growth more inclusive and reduce risks of poverty.</p>

Higher food prices and rising administered prices will continue to push inflation above the 6% upper limit of the target band in 2016. The weaker currency will push up inflation and low profitability means that cost increases are more likely to be passed on. Oil prices have worked in the opposite direction. However, the effect on inflation of the sharp spike in food prices should diminish in the near term and therefore monetary policy can remain in a fairly supportive stance while being ready to counter a build-up of trend inflation. </p>

Owing to the low growth potential, sustainably reducing debt would require an improvement in the structural balance. The neutral stance is appropriate, as it balances the need for continued growth and job creation with the need to gradually reduce public debt. Monetary policy in the euro area will remain highly accommodative, boosting investment and consumption via lower lending rates. However, other forces supporting the recovery will lessen. External demand has lost some momentum as many emerging market economies have weakened, and the positive impact of falling oil prices will moderate. Political uncertainty since the general election in December 2015 will weigh on demand, if it continues. </p>

Additional measures, such as reducing the degree of vertical integration in the electricity market and lowering the barriers to entry into professional professions, would contribute to higher productivity. The unemployment rate is set to remain close to 20% with a large share of long-term unemployment and one of highest levels of youth unemployment in the OECD. Improving job opportunities for the unemployed and facilitating their return to work is key to reducing income inequality and including more people in the benefits of the economic recovery. More reforms are needed to boost the resources and efficiency of public employment services, strengthening activation for the unemployed, and allocating more funds towards effective training schemes. Tackling early school leaving and providing second-chance opportunities for those who have not completed secondary education would help to boost skills at the same time as contributing to reduce youth unemployment. </p>

The negative effects of the sharp exchange rate appreciation in January 2015 are fading, and exchange rate stability since last summer has contributed to a rebound in exports. However, some other components of demand are still suffering, including business investment and consumption of durable goods. Employment growth has resumed. Consumer price deflation has persisted through 2015 and thus far in 2016, but in part this has reflected the transitory effects of the sharp oil price declines. Business and household confidence were hit by the 2015 appreciation, but it has now improved notably in manufacturing. The persistently large current account surplus, which averaged almost 11½ per cent of GDP in 2015, dropped in the fourth quarter, owing to a fall in primary income. </p>

Reducing the cost of childcare and reforming second-earner taxation would remove impediments to full-time work and make it easier to reconcile careers and home life. Pushing forward with free-trade agreements – particularly with India and the United States – would favour growth. Immigration of highly-skilled workers has contributed to past productivity performance but is now endangered by the imposition of quotas scheduled for 2017.</p>

At the same time, exporters of manufactured goods gained market share in the EU and US markets. Still, total goods and services exports declined in volume in 2015, while the current account deficit fell owing to the sharp drop in oil prices. The Russian embargo on Turkey’s exports from January 2016 heralds further contraction of the Russian market, notably for tourism which accounts for 7% of total employment. Foreign funding needs, which will approach 20% of GDP in 2016, have so far been financed smoothly by capital inflows. </p>

But they are also heightening pressures on inflation, which had reached 8.8% at the end of 2015 before declining to 7.5% at the end of the first quarter thanks to favourable food prices and a stronger exchange rate. Despite competitiveness losses induced by the minimum wage jump, business confidence was helped by a Government Action Plan announced in early 2016 which included important structural reform objectives in labour and product markets. If fully implemented, this programme should support firms in the formal sector and thereby create higher-productivity and better-paid jobs. At the same time, tensions in the Eastern regions, persisting geopolitical strains across borders and terrorist attacks in early 2016 have affected general confidence. </p>

The fiscal stance will be expansionary in 2016 with the fulfilment of election promises, but spending restraint is planned from 2017, with the share of general government spending in GDP inching back down to 41%. Monetary policy was loosened between February and April in the context of supportive global financing conditions, with a decline in the average funding rate of the central bank and cuts in the upper end of the interest-rate corridor. Macro-prudential policies were slightly relaxed, facilitating the use of credit cards for certain categories of consumer purchases. </p>

Inflation is projected to be just under 8% in the second half of 2016, well above the target of 5%, before subsiding somewhat in 2017. If the intended structural reforms proceed, and domestic political and regional geopolitical conditions improve, stronger private investment and exports may propel growth to higher levels. The projection, however, is conditional on political stability and assumes that the key orientations of the existing medium-term economic framework are retained. If not, or if regional and domestic tensions were to intensify, domestic demand and tourism would be adversely affected. Any associated weakening in international confidence may trigger capital outflows and exchange-rate volatility, weighing on short-term growth. In addition, Turkey is exposed to global risks arising from China’s prospects and from the expected normalisation of US monetary policy and would be negatively affected by a slowdown in Europe.</p>

Financial markets have also increasingly started to price in the risk of Brexit. The exchange rate has fallen and the cost of protection against its future volatility has increased.

Growth is set to be weak and volatile in the first half of 2016 owing to the impact of the referendum on spending decisions, mainly of businesses. However, GDP growth will strengthen in the second half of 2016 as uncertainty dissipates, and stabilise at 2% in 2017. This growth will be enough to keep the unemployment rate low. </p>
          <p id="IDf939c109-791e-46ae-8c3b-10c88fa77fc3" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The outcome of the referendum is a major risk for the economy. A vote for Brexit would heighten uncertainty, raise the cost of finance and hamper investment. According to OECD estimates, GDP growth could be lower by 0.5 percentage point in 2017 and 2018 and by 1.5 percentage points in 2019. The Bank of England could stabilise the financial sector through liquidity support, but refinancing of public debt could become more costly. The large current account deficit may also be harder to finance, which could force a costly adjustment. Higher productivity growth would sustain economic activity and wages, and improve public finances more than projected. Stronger demand from the euro area would limit the extent of the current account deficit by supporting exports, but this could be offset by further headwinds from emerging markets.</p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Productivity growth has been especially slow in recent years, intensifying a broad-based deceleration initiated in the early 2000s. Although cyclical weakness in demand has contributed to the slowdown, there are signs that structural forces are undermining allocative efficiency, including declines in business dynamism, signs of diminished competitive pressures, and sagging public infrastructure provision. Multiple policies to reinvigorate productivity would be appropriate, such as targeted investments in public infrastructure, eliminating needless inter-jurisdictional differences in occupational licensing, and broadening the scope of antitrust laws.</emphasis>

However, in late 2015 and early 2016, activity was weighed down by transitory pressures, including an inventory investment correction and the drag on net exports from earlier strengthening in the dollar. Recent softness may also reflect measurement difficulties, as a recurring pattern of early-year lurches in real GDP growth has eluded seasonal adjustments (which are applied to the individual data series used to construct aggregate expenditures and not to the aggregates themselves). Transitory fluctuations aside, domestic demand is being supported by income from steady job gains, which is boosting household consumption and new housing demand. However, business investment has been lacklustre, in part because of sustained downward pressure on drilling and mining investment from low oil prices, and the drag on final demand from weak external markets.</p>

The unemployment rate has been hovering near estimates of the natural rate for some time, and the participation rate has recently climbed toward its estimated structural level. But these structural levels are measured imprecisely, and signs of slack remain for less-skilled workers (a group tilted toward lower wage earners such as teenagers and ethnic minorities), workers employed part-time for economic reasons, and some other groups. In any case, acceleration in nominal compensation per hour has so far been weak. With the labour market expected to tighten further, wage growth is likely to strengthen, which will provide welcome support to household income and consumer spending. Wage acceleration would be particularly supportive if it boosted earnings for those at the lower end of the earnings distribution. </p>

General government gross debt stabilises near 114% of GDP in 2016 as the maturing recovery drives down the overall deficit. In December, Congress made permanent a number of tax incentives—including credits for renewable energy generation and research and development—that had previously been extended annually, thus eliminating delays and uncertainty. The deceleration in health outlays has made fiscal consolidation less urgent for now, but federal debt is still elevated by historical standards and could be placed on an unsustainable course by fiscal indiscipline or by further sluggish productivity growth.</p>

This partly reflects unusual cyclical employment dynamics, with outsized layoffs in the crisis aftermath followed by unusually strong hiring thereafter, and with capital accumulation restrained by sluggish post-crisis aggregate demand. Even so, productivity has suffered a broad-based deceleration since the early-to-mid 2000s, and this may owe to structural forces that are undermining allocative efficiency – such as diminished business dynamism, weaker competitive pressures, and sagging public infrastructure. These same structural forces may be contributing to widening and persistent income inequality as well. A multi-pronged strategy to reinvigorate productivity would be appropriate, including targeted infrastructure investments to stimulate aggregate demand and improve efficiency, as well as structural measures such as broadening the scope of antitrust laws and eliminating needless variations in occupational licensing across jurisdictions.</p>

Domestic demand strengthens, on balance, as inventory investment flattens, oil drilling fades as a share of GDP, and business investment re-accelerates to rates in line with activity. Exports are also projected to strengthen as the drag from previous dollar appreciation wanes and export markets pick up. Household spending gradually loses vigour as the boost to real disposable income from wage acceleration is insufficient to offset the deceleration in employment as demographic pressures on labour market participation increasingly bind. </p>

Wages could accelerate more forcefully than expected, igniting inflationary pressures. Alternatively, relatively weak demand conditions could be more sustained than expected, unleashing a more intense drag from net exports and production as well as disinflationary pressures. Hourly labour compensation could also fail to accelerate, which could endanger the recovery if coupled with a deceleration in employment from demographic pressures. Remaining slack in the labour market could be substantially wider than thought, implying less inflationary pressure and a more gradual normalisation of monetary policy. </p>
