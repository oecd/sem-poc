Deploy effective fiscal initiatives and promote inclusive trade policies to escape from the low-growth trap </mainhead>
      </heading>
      <p id="ID28c4a17a-5816-41ae-8495-eff0a0a04fae" instlang="en" indent="n" numbering="n">For the last five years the global economy has been in a low-growth trap, with growth disappointingly low and stuck at around 3 per cent per year. Persistent growth shortfalls have weighed on future output expectations and thereby reduced current spending and potential output gains. Around the world, private investment has been weak, public investment has slowed, and global trade growth has collapsed, all of which have limited the improvements in employment, labour productivity and wages needed to support sustainable gains in living standards.  Overall, a slowdown in structural policy ambition and policy incoherence have slowed business dynamism, trapped resources in unproductive firms, weakened financial institutions and undermined productivity growth. In the face of these limited prospects, the OECD has argued in previous <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlooks</emphasis> that fiscal, monetary and structural policies need to be deployed comprehensively and collectively for economies to grow sufficiently to make good on promises to their citizens. </p>
      <p id="ID65d2bcde-67c9-4384-bd84-25785f722b88" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The projections in this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> offer the prospect that fiscal initiatives could catalyse private economic activity and push the global economy to the modestly higher growth rate of around 3½ per cent by 2018.  Durable exit from the low-growth trap depends on policy choices beyond those of the monetary authorities – that is, of fiscal and structural, including trade policies – as well as on concerted and effective implementation.  Collective fiscal action undertaken by all countries, including a more expansionary stance than planned in many countries in Europe, would support domestic and global growth even for those economies, who by virtue of specific circumstances, need to consolidate their fiscal positions or pursue a more neutral stance.</p>
      <p id="ID7277a6b8-ddff-4da6-ba2f-343206f05825" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Some might argue that there is no space for such fiscal initiatives, given the heavy public debt burden in many economies.  In fact, following five years of intense fiscal consolidation, debt-to-GDP ratios in most advanced countries have flattened.  It is past time to focus on expanding the denominator – GDP growth. This <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> argues that the current conjuncture of extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy with very low interest rates opens a window of opportunity to deploy fiscal initiatives. Fiscal space has been created by lower interest payments on rolled-over debt, which also increases gauges of market access and of debt sustainability. On average, OECD economies could deploy deficit‑financed fiscal initiatives for three to four years, while still leaving debt-to-GDP ratios unchanged in the long term.  A front-loaded effort could allow deficit finance to taper sooner and put the debt-to-GDP ratio sustainably on a downward path.</p>
      <p id="ID0c415552-ea07-4ddc-ac6b-ada70f493af1" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The key is to deploy the right kind of fiscal initiatives that support demand in the short run and supply in the long run and address not just growth challenges but also inequality concerns.  These include soft investments in education and R&amp;D along with hard investment in public infrastructures. Such fiscal initiatives would improve outcomes for demand and supply potential even more for economies suffering from long-term unemployment, when undertaken collectively, and when fiscal initiatives are complemented by country-specific structural policies put together in a coherent package. The mix is different for different countries, as developed in Chapter 2, with further details in the Country Notes in <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDfef951de-f204-4498-8775-90fe03b69ac9"/> of this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>.</p>
      <p id="IDc28e637f-5664-4740-9b19-6406de5f40a3" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Against this backdrop of fiscal initiatives, reviving trade growth through better policies would help to push the global economy out of the low-growth trap, as well as support revived productivity growth.  In this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> trade growth is projected to increase from a dismal ratio of global trade-to-GDP growth of around 0.8 to be about on par with global output growth – remaining much less than the multiple of 2 enjoyed over the last few decades. This sluggish trade growth compared to historical experience shaves some 0.2 percentage point from total factor productivity growth – which may seem minor – but is meaningful given the slow productivity growth of some 0.5% per year during the post-crisis period. </p>
      <p id="ID31b8066e-b3bd-49bf-b3da-240d5865abb2" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Some argue that slowing globalization would temper the brunt of adjustments to workers and firms.  This <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis> suggests that protectionism and inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the effects of the fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth, raise prices, harm living standards, and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position. Trade protectionism shelters some jobs, but worsens prospects and lowers well‑being for many others.  In many OECD countries, more than 25% of jobs depend on foreign demand.  Instead, policymakers need to implement the structural policy packages that create more job opportunities, increase business dynamism, promote successful reallocation and enhance policies to ensure that gains from trade are better shared.  Fortunately, the country-specific policy packages that make fiscal initiatives more effective in promoting demand growth and supply potential also help to make growth more inclusive. </p>
      <p id="ID9a7d8bc0-c0d4-4bdf-adf2-618bc29eadd8" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The transition path to a more balanced policy set and higher sustainable growth involves financial risks. But so too does the status quo dependence on extraordinary monetary policy.  Pricing distortions in financial markets abound.  Yield curves are still fairly flat, with negative interest rates.  Pricing of credit risk has narrowed even as issuance of riskier bonds has increased.  Real estate prices continue to advance in many markets, even in the face of attempted tempering by macro-prudential measures. Expectations in currency markets are on edge as evidenced by high measures of currency volatility.  These financial distortions and risks expose vulnerable balance sheets of firms in emerging markets, and challenge bank profitability and the long-term stability of pension schemes in advanced economies. </p>
      <p id="IDb603495f-b775-47a6-a71d-042215b0d736" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The fiscal initiatives in conjunction with trade and structural policies, as outlined in the scenarios in this <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>, should revive expectations for faster and more inclusive growth, thus allowing monetary policy to move toward a more neutral stance in the United States at least, and possibly other countries as well. The risk of a growing divergence in monetary policy stances in the major economies over the next two years could be a new source of financial market tensions even as growth picks up, thus putting a premium on collective action by countries to revive growth in tandem. </p>
      <p id="ID0c864cf2-bf9e-40df-9956-cbb3526c1b73" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In sum, policymakers should closely examine fiscal space; low interest rates enable many countries to boost hard and soft infrastructure and other growth-enhancing initiatives. Avoiding trade pitfalls, coupled with social measures to better share the gains from globalization and technological change, are key policy priorities. Using the window of opportunity created by monetary policy and following through on fiscal and structural measures should raise growth expectations and create the necessary momentum for the global economy to escape the low-growth trap. </p>

        <p id="ID416b2ad3-73a7-4b7e-a9a3-1a16601dca79" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">For the last five years the global economy has been in a low-growth trap, with growth disappointingly low and stuck at around 3%. Persistent growth shortfalls have weighed on future output expectations and thereby reduced current spending and potential output growth. Global trade and investment have been weak, limiting the advances in labour productivity and wages that are required to support sustainable consumption growth. However, fiscal policies, both implemented and proposed, could, if effective, catalyse private economic activity and push the global economy to a modestly higher growth rate of around 3½ per cent by 2018. Exiting the low-growth trap depends on policy choices, as well as on concerted and effective implementation. If, as assumed in the projections, the incoming US Administration implements a significant and effective fiscal initiative that boosts domestic investment and consumption, global growth could increase by 0.1 percentage point in 2017 and 0.3 percentage point in 2018. If the fiscal stimulus underway in China continues to support demand, this could also bolster global growth by 0.2 percentage points per annum on average over 2017-18. A more robust fiscal easing than currently projected in many other advanced economies, including in the EU, would further support domestic and global activity. OECD analysis of fiscal space indicates that the EU has room for more concerted action.</p>
        <p id="ID17511f66-c514-4113-bcc8-dad6eef32590" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Against this backdrop of fiscal initiatives, progress on trade policy would help propel the global economy out of the low-growth trap as well as support a revival of productivity. On the other hand, worsening protectionism and the threat of trade retaliation could offset much of the fiscal initiatives’ impact on domestic and global growth, leaving countries with a poorer fiscal position as well. With pressures in labour and product markets building only slowly, inflation should remain modest in most economies, although resource pressures could start to emerge in the United States. If expectations of medium and longer-term growth revive, thus allowing monetary policy to move toward a more neutral stance in the United States, it might help to ameliorate some existing distortions in financial markets, such as a lack of term and credit risk premia. However, the risk of a growing divergence in the monetary policy stance in the major economies over the next two years could be a new source of financial market tensions. New challenges have also arisen from the UK vote to leave the European Union, raising the prospect of an extended period of uncertainty until the future scope of trade relationships with the rest of the European Union becomes clear.</p>
        <p id="IDe4186ca1-9ecd-4c9d-b082-8d30cfa4e5f0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In order to ensure the exit from the low-growth equilibrium, there is a need for effective and collective policy efforts to support aggregate demand in the short term and raise potential growth in the longer term. Towards these ends, accommodative monetary policy needs to be complemented by enhanced collective use of fiscal and more ambitious structural policies and avoidance of more widespread trade protectionism. Financial market distortions and prospects for greater volatility imply that there is no scope to expand monetary easing beyond existing plans in the main advanced economies. On the other hand, countries should closely examine fiscal space with lower interest rates enabling countries to boost hard and soft infrastructure and other growth-enhancing spending for an average of four years while leaving debt-to-GDP ratios unchanged (see <xref object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID52982fa9-c2b0-4bbd-948d-a74bddd4e021"/>). Collective action in this area, including reallocating public spending towards more growth-friendly items, would catalyse business investment and deliver additional output gains from cross-country spillovers. Fiscal choices depend on structural policies, otherwise they will fail to strengthen productivity growth and labour utilisation and will undermine debt sustainability. Given the dramatic slowdown in trade, reversing protectionist measures since the crisis and further expanding the scope for international trade, coupled with measures to better share the gains from trade, are key collective structural policy priorities. A bold and comprehensive use of monetary, fiscal and structural measures should raise growth expectations and reduce risk perceptions, and thereby put the global economy on a sustainable higher-growth path.</p>

        <p id="ID71046d97-33f1-4b9e-9bad-07e26b38d703" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Prospects for sub-par global growth persist despite the low-interest rate environment (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID12a0d19a-a2ac-4bed-acaf-a8f670dec096"/>), reflecting poor underlying supply-side developments, modest aggregate demand and diminished reform efforts. Despite an upturn in the third quarter of 2016, global GDP growth is estimated to have again been around 3% this year, over ¾ percentage point weaker than the average in the two decades prior to the crisis. In the absence of action to remedy this persistent shortfall, it will be increasingly difficult for governments to meet all of their implicit future commitments to society, or even meet current expectations for their citizens. While there are signs that output growth has now started to edge up in the emerging and developing economies after a prolonged slowdown, helped by the near-term effects of policy support in China and easing recessions in many commodity producers, the advanced economies have yet to collectively gain much additional momentum. </p>

This adds to downside risks, with likely negative effects on activity if it persists. Despite this, equity market turbulence has eased after sharp initial reactions to the results of the US election and UK referendum, although bond market volatility has risen. Government bond yields have turned up from historic lows in many economies, helped by higher market expectations of future inflation and hence the future pace of policy interest rate rises in the United States.</p>

The extent to which the fiscal programme set out by the new Administration during the election campaign is implemented will not become clear for some time, as agreement by Congress will be required to introduce necessary legislation and in some areas, notably tax reform, complex legislative changes may be needed. Nonetheless, it seems likely that there will be some easing of fiscal policy over the next two years, with implications for growth prospects and inflation in the United States and other economies. </p>

              </li>
            </randlist>
            <p id="ID-42-1164258" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Given that some time will be needed to enact the necessary legislation to achieve these measures, the additional spending is assumed to be implemented from the second quarter of 2017, with the household tax reduction phased in over the course of 2017. The NiGEM model was run in backward-looking mode, reflecting a judgment that in a period characterised by considerable uncertainty, businesses and households would be unlikely to behave as if fiscal measures were known with certainty before they are legislated. Monetary policy was allowed to remain endogenous in the United States, but policy interest rates were kept fixed in other economies. The US budget solvency rule was switched off, so that the additional spending and reduced taxation initially raise the budget deficit. </p>
            <p id="ID-42-1164263" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">All told, the combined fiscal measures raise calendar year US GDP growth by around 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and a little over 0.8 percentage points in 2018 (see first figure). Business investment rises relatively rapidly, and is around 5½ per cent above baseline by 2018, adding to productive potential. The unemployment rate declines further, by just under ½ percentage point by 2018, and signs of resource pressures start to emerge, with consumer price inflation rising by 0.1 percentage point in 2017 and 0.4 percentage point in 2018. Stronger growth relative to potential and higher inflation prompt tighter policy interest rates, which rise relative to the very low baseline level by around ¼ percentage point in 2017 and ¾ percentage point in 2018. This helps to push up long-term interest rates which are around 40 basis points above baseline in 2018.</p>
            <p id="ID-42-1164268" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The boost to US final demand also strengthens import growth, with import volumes around 3% above their baseline value in 2018. This has modest positive spillover effects on other economies (see first figure), particularly Canada and Mexico (in the assumed absence of any offsetting trade policy measures). Overall, the stimulus boosts global GDP growth by around 0.1 percentage point in 2017 and 0.3 percentage point in 2018, with world trade growth rising by ¼ percentage point and ½ percentage point in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In the absence of the US fiscal stimulus, projected GDP growth in 2018 would be largely unchanged from that in 2017 in most countries (see second figure).</p>
            <p id="ID-42-1164273" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The initial ex-ante increase in the US budget deficit from stronger expenditure and lower taxes is offset in part by the favourable fiscal effects of stronger economic activity, so that the actual increase in the budget deficit relative to baseline is around ½ per cent of GDP in 2017 and 1½ per cent of GDP in 2018, as compared with the respective ex-ante rise in the deficit of ¾ per cent of GDP in 2017 and 1¾ per cent of GDP in 2018. The US government debt-to-GDP ratio declines marginally in both years, by around ½ per cent of GDP in 2018, despite the increases in the deficit-to-GDP ratio and long-term government bond yields. This is because the favourable impact of the increase in (nominal) GDP on the debt-to-GDP ratio more than offsets the impact of the higher budget deficit in the near term.</p>

                <p id="ID-42-1167823" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Some of the fiscal measures introduced are likely to be permanent, particularly any corporate tax change, with longer-term implications for future fiscal deficits and debt. Knowledge that these may need to be offset in the future by either higher taxation or lower spending could serve to damp the short-term response of private sector demand to the stimulus. The stimulus measures could raise potential output in the longer-term, and thereby help with public debt sustainability, especially if businesses respond to lower corporate taxes by durably raising capital investment rather than by raising dividends or financial investments, but the extent to which this occurs is very uncertain.</p>
              </li>
              <li id="ID-42-1167832" numbering="n">
                <p id="ID-42-1167835" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The extent to which tax reductions support demand will depend in practice on distributional issues as well as the size of any overall reduction in revenue. To the extent that higher-income households or cash-rich companies benefit from lower taxes than otherwise, the resulting additional revenue might be saved rather than used to finance additional final expenditure.</p>

                <p id="ID-42-1167863" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A more aggressive monetary policy response in the United States, and associated larger appreciation of the US dollar, would also damp the short-term growth effects in the United States. However, it could provide some additional support to aggregate demand in other economies whose currencies depreciate, provided it did not add to financial market volatility. A stronger rise in term premia on long-term government bonds as a result of higher expected future government debt would also damp the response to the fiscal stimulus.</p>

This would limit the emergence of inflationary pressures and reduce the need for increases in US policy interest rates.</p>

OECD GDP growth is projected to pick up to just over 2¼ per cent by 2018 from 1¾ per cent this year (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDf8186922-fa35-4682-95ad-47952df99a8d"/>, Panel A). In the absence of US fiscal support, OECD GDP growth would average under 2% per annum over 2017-18, little different from the outcomes in 2015-16. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are likely to experience mixed outcomes, reflecting differences in policy support, sensitivity to commodity prices, progress in enacting structural reforms, and financial vulnerabilities. Overall, growth is set to pick up slowly in the next two years, driven by a gradual easing of the recessions in Brazil, Russia and other commodity-producing countries (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDf8186922-fa35-4682-95ad-47952df99a8d"/>, Panel B).

An assumed fiscal easing, via rises in government spending and household and corporate tax reductions, is projected to provide an additional stimulus to domestic demand through the next two years, especially business investment, despite somewhat higher long-term interest rates. Under this scenario, GDP growth is projected to average just over 2½ per cent per annum in 2017-18. In the absence of these additional measures, GDP growth would likely be closer to 2% per annum on average over 2017-18.</p>
            <p id="IDf523bb12-34bf-407c-8250-d6dcc816e8db" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In Japan, GDP growth is set to remain modest at between ¾ and 1% per annum over 2017-18, as the effects of the past appreciation of the yen and weak Asian trade on exports moderate, and exports respond to stronger US import demand. A projected modest fiscal easing will also help to support activity next year, but with fiscal headwinds due to intensify again from 2018, the key issue will be the extent to which capacity and labour shortages and strong profits feed through into corporate spending and wages. </p>
            <p id="ID009dee0c-9d49-434d-a451-c636c1f6c475" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In the euro area, growth is projected to remain between 1½ and 1¾ per cent per annum. Despite accommodative monetary policy and a modest fiscal easing over 2016-18, domestic demand remains moderate, held back by soft investment, still-high unemployment and high non-performing loans in some countries. Exports will benefit from stronger US import demand. However, negative effects from weaker demand growth in the United Kingdom and uncertainty about the future course of the European Union are also likely to become apparent over the next two years. A more robust use of fiscal space would improve prospects for both the EU and for the rest of the world, and encourage a sustained exit from the low-growth trap.</p>
            <p id="IDb7ad311b-257a-4366-9072-15bf77e25932" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Prospects in the United Kingdom are considerably weaker than set out prior to the vote to exit the European Union, with GDP growth projected to average between 1 and 1¼ per cent per annum over 2017-18, despite the additional policy support provided by more accommodative monetary policy and the easing of the sizeable fiscal tightening previously planned in 2017 and 2018. Uncertainty about the future direction of policy, the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and the reaction of the economy remains high, and is likely to persist even beyond an assumed departure from the European Union in 2019 with trade arrangements based on most favoured nation (MFN) rates. This will weigh on business investment, which is projected to decline sharply over the next two years. Some support to exports will be provided by the large sterling depreciation, but this will also raise inflation and damp real income growth.<boxnoteref refid="IDc5a26cfa-e9c6-45e8-ac21-e52d01cf0529" format="boxnoteref"/> Spillovers to the global economy are likely to become apparent over the course of the next two years.</p>
            <p id="ID1a5aa3ea-cfff-47f3-8b6f-d5b8cd088020" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In China, growth is projected to continue to ease, to around 6¼ per cent on average over 2017-18, as the support from policy stimulus eases and demand is further rebalanced towards domestic sources. Managing this rebalancing alongside financial system risks remains a key challenge. In India, a large increase in public sector wages and the recent passage of key structural reforms, particularly the goods and services tax, will help to keep GDP growth at a little over 7½ per cent per annum by raising incentives for business investment. In many other Asian economies, including Indonesia, solid domestic demand growth continues, supported by strong government investment in infrastructure or credit expansion, offsetting the drag from weak trade developments in China. In Brazil and Russia, a slow recovery is projected to get underway in the next two years, helped by firmer commodity prices, recent improvements in confidence and monetary policy support as inflation eases. </p>
            <p id="ID-42-1170247" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Against the backdrop for subdued aggregate demand growth, inflationary pressures are projected to remain muted in most economies. Headline consumer price inflation has begun to rise in the major advanced economies, but this largely reflects the recent strengthening of commodity prices. Input prices are also rising in many EMEs, notably China, where producer price inflation is now positive for the first time in four years. Core inflation has remained comparatively stable, at low levels, reflecting persistent economic slack and weak global price pressures, particularly in Japan where the effective exchange rate has appreciated substantially over the past year. </p>
            <p id="ID-42-1170252" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In the absence of significant further moves in commodity prices, exchange rates and inflation expectations, core inflation is projected to edge up slowly over the next two years in the advanced economies, but only to the extent that economic slack, cyclically adjusted, declines. Should demand rebound, investment and the re-entry of discouraged workers would tend to increase supply, easing pressures on resources. Inflation is projected to be around 2½ per cent by the latter part of 2018 in the United States, if fiscal stimulus is implemented as assumed, but to remain under 1¼ per cent and 1½ per cent respectively in Japan and the euro area. Amongst the major EMEs, consumer price inflation is projected to remain low in China and ease slowly in Brazil and Russia, helped by the impact of currency stabilisation. In India, inflationary pressures should also remain contained, although the goods and services tax could result in a one-off rise in the price level.</p>

Import volume growth in the emerging and developing economies is particularly weak, even allowing for the declines in import penetration that are persisting in China.<fnote id="ID03f391d7-f095-4201-bf1f-144e3f1546bd"><p id="IDad55fe3e-e5b0-4192-b97e-4a6f2f612e50" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Excluding China, non-OECD import volumes (goods plus services) are projected to decline by over 1% this year, after falling by over 2½ per cent in 2015. A slow upturn to growth of around 2% per annum is projected in 2017-18.</p></fnote> OECD analysis suggests that structural factors, such as a slowdown of trade liberalisation, new protectionist measures since the crisis and a contraction of global value chains (particularly in China and East Asia) account for a significant proportion of the moderation in trade growth over the past five years (Haugh et al., 2016). Cyclical factors, including the deep recessions in some commodity producing economies, and the widespread weakness of fixed investment, have compounded structural problems. If fiscal initiatives, both implemented and proposed including infrastructure investment, catalyse business investment, global trade could be stronger than currently projected. Measures to reduce global trade facilitation costs would deliver
further benefits (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDa21028c9-0a1c-46f4-9247-85f0d04e7ebd"/>). On the other hand, if additional protectionist measures were introduced over the next two years in the major economies, global trade growth would be softer still, with negative consequences for productivity growth.</p>

Trade enhances competitive pressures, enables greater specialisation and improved resource allocation, facilitates knowledge transfer and is essential for the functioning of global value chains. Therefore policies which impact on trade will affect output and productivity. With increased fragmentation of production across national borders (with intermediate inputs potentially crossing national borders multiple times), small changes in trade costs can have a sizeable impact on trade because of their cumulative effect. Policies that affect trade are therefore a critical element of responses to the low-growth trap. Stylised scenarios show the benefits of modest trade-enhancing actions versus the costs of policies that would throw sand in the wheels of global value chains. </p>

This assumes that trade costs are reduced by 1.3% uniformly across all sectors in all countries. The assumed trade cost reduction is derived from the OECD’s Trade Facilitation Indicators (Moïsé, 2013).<boxnoteref refid="BIHHHGAA" format="boxnoteref"/> Based on the OECD METRO model (2015a), this would raise world GDP by about 1.5% and world trade by 1.7%. These effects would not occur immediately, but only once there had been full adjustment of demand and factors of production, although part of this might be expected to have been completed within the time horizon covered by the <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Outlook</emphasis>. There would be productivity improvements over a number of years due to the efficiency gains from the lower costs of serving export markets. There could also be a positive but small increase in long-run total factor productivity associated with the increase in trade openness.</p>

This magnitude is roughly equivalent to an average increase of tariffs to the bound tariff rates in 2001, the year when the trade negotiations under the Doha Development Round started.The effects would have a major adverse impact on trade and GDP, with those countries that imposed new trade barriers being the most severely affected (see first figure). </p>

If collective trade policy helped global and OECD trade intensity to rise at the average pace observed over the two decades prior to the crisis, instead of remaining broadly unchanged, total factor productivity growth could be boosted by 0.2 percentage point per annum in the medium term, drawing on estimates about the link between trade openness and productivity growth in Égert and Gal (2016). This would raise annual TFP growth in the OECD economies by around one-third (see second figure). </p>

Estimates of potential output per capita growth have been revised down repeatedly in the aftermath of the crisis, reflecting a slowdown in trend labour productivity growth due to weak investment and slower growth of total factor productivity, along with demographic effects in some countries (Ollivaud et al., 2016). For the OECD as a whole, per capita trend output growth is estimated at 0.9% in 2016-18, unchanged from the average growth rate since 2009, but 1¼ percentage points below the average achieved in the 1980s and 1990s. Potential output growth in the BRIICS on a per capita basis has also been revised down in recent years, by over 1¾ percentage points in China since 2011 and 1 percentage point in the remaining economies.</p>

In the absence of policy measures to strengthen demand and longer-term growth prospects, this trap is likely to deepen, with negative longer-run consequences for jobs, incomes and inclusiveness. On the other hand, effective fiscal policy, implemented now during the window
of low interest rates and in conjunction with country-appropriate structural and trade policies, could change expectations, thus generating a positive feedback loop between expectations and actual GDP growth.</p>

Very accommodative monetary policy and the pressures on the business models of financial institutions (see below) may also be raising bank forbearance. Consequently, some failing firms could be kept in business, hampering the reallocation of resources towards more productive activities (Adalet McGowan et al., 2016). At the same time, product market reforms have been limited in many sectors, especially retail trade and professional services. </p>

Growth in the advanced economies has been unbalanced, both in terms of developments across economies and in terms of the composition of expenditure. Consumers’ expenditure and fixed investment have both been persistently weaker than in past recoveries from recessions, but investment has failed to keep pace even with the modest rise in consumption, in contrast to earlier recoveries (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDe3c628a7-20b9-4524-b3dd-6833ff17e742"/>). In the near term, the gentle upturn in household demand can be met from existing capacity, but this cannot be sustained indefinitely without generating imbalances, inequalities and vulnerabilities. Stronger policy measures to support final demand are necessary to mitigate such outcomes. </p>

In some countries (including the United States, Germany and Japan) prospects for more robust job and consumption growth are limited by policies that undermine labour force participation by key segments of the potential work force. Elsewhere, including many euro area countries hardest hit by the crisis and by fiscal consolidation, considerable labour market slack remains. These differences are reflected in the growth of real compensation per employee, which is projected to pick up to around 1¾ and 1½ per cent per annum respectively in the United States and Germany over 2017-18, but remain subdued, given weaker productivity growth, at around ¾ per cent per annum in Japan and ½ per cent per annum in the rest of the euro area.</p>

In such countries, real mean income growth outpaced real median income growth, including in some of euro area economies heavily affected by the crisis where real income declines occurred across a broad range of households. Across countries, there is a positive correlation between the difference in mean and median income growth since the mid-2000s and the difference between annual income and consumption growth, although the relationship is not especially strong (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID381db014-17cc-4c6a-bb68-a205eeda46f2"/>).

In the decade prior to the financial crisis, there was a strong positive association between house price growth and the extent to which consumption growth outpaced income growth in most advanced economies (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID375c9e3a-edf3-4a3d-82b4-f98a6b776687"/>). The relationship has become far more heterogeneous since the crisis, with house price developments appearing to have little consistent relationship with spending and saving. Indeed, some of the countries with comparatively strong house price growth in recent years, including Australia, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland, are amongst those countries in which income growth has exceeded consumption growth (on average) over the past eight years. The changing influence of house prices could reflect changes in financial regulations and credit standards in recent years, reducing the ability of households to use rising housing values as collateral for additional borrowing to fund current spending. Lower loan-to-value ratios, in part reflecting tighter prudential supervision, might also have increased the need for households to save in order to undertake housing purchases. All told, relative to the pre-crisis period, there are comparatively few signs of a build-up of vulnerabilities stemming from strong household spending growth being driven by rising leverage and inflated asset prices.</p>

Necessary reforms to strengthen bank balance sheets and improve financial supervision and regulation also damp the balance sheet channel of monetary policy by lowering the extent to which households can use rising asset values as collateral for additional borrowing.<fnote id="ID141e88df-4579-4ce1-a00d-82464f46a917"><p id="IDbff5e490-e58f-485b-8f7a-cc7ce9b460e5" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">High wealth inequality may also be reducing the effective support to private consumption from monetary policy stimulus, although such effects are estimated to be small in recent years once account is taken of the support to house prices and employment (Bernanke, 2015; O’Farrell et al., 2016).</p></fnote> Moreover, as discussed below, the pressures being placed on the business models of many life insurance companies and pension funds by an extended period of very low interest rates may also be encouraging households to save in response to reduced expected future returns.

          <p id="ID4bbd72e5-7092-4bcf-bf96-075cd5fa34fa" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Sovereign bond yields have risen from their historical lows reached last summer, with a particularly sharp increase after the US elections. However, they still remain low by historic standards, especially in the euro area and Japan. The decline in bond yields in recent years reflected persistent weak growth after the financial crisis with associated excess savings by businesses and households. Sovereign bond yields have also been pushed lower by higher demand for safe assets, at a time when the supply of such assets from the private sector has been reduced, with certain private asset classes losing their investment-grade status after the crisis (Caballero and Farhi, 2013). Before the US elections, disappointing GDP growth outcomes fuelled expectations of sustained and stronger monetary policy intervention in the markets in the main advanced economies. Indeed, the fall in expected market overnight interest rates (proxies of policy rates) over the next five years largely corresponds to the decline in 5-year sovereign bond yields in Europe, Japan and the United States (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDb8f9dc95-b957-456c-92ef-76e49e7d094b"/>). Even after the post-US-election snapback in bond yields in mid-November, bond valuations remain particularly extreme in Europe and Japan, where the share of sovereign bonds trading at negative yields is estimated to be above 50% in several countries (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID68bc2e4b-8c89-4b73-87ef-60986414b072"/>). Consequently, around USD 12 trillion of government bonds, representing around 31% of OECD government debt, are estimated to have negative yields currently.</p>

In all areas, they have, however, remained below country-specific historical averages from the early 1980s.</p></fnote> An extended period of low interest rates has induced portfolio rebalancing towards equities and raised the present value of expected future profits. By stimulating corporate borrowing, it has also contributed to large-scale share buybacks (OECD, 2016b), high dividend payouts per share and relative to net income (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID48d9edd7-a3b5-4e91-bc28-7419e378152f"/>) and strong merger and acquisition activity. All of these have pushed up equity prices. They have also been boosted by strong profit growth over recent years, with modest wage growth and other cost-cutting measures outweighing very weak productivity growth. There are, however, limits to such profit gains if weak nominal output growth is sustained. </p>

The rise in real estate prices has pushed up price-to-rent ratios to record highs in one-third of OECD member states, including Canada and several European countries. In the United States, commercial property prices corrected for GDP inflation have also gone up, approaching the pre-crisis peak. So far, appreciating property prices have not been accompanied by a rapid increase in household debt, reflecting moderate growth in household mortgage debt, in contrast to the period before the crisis. However, in a number of countries, including Australia, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom, debt in relation to household income has remained high. </p>

This has already happened after the US elections and during the so-called taper tantrum in 2013. The initial price correction could be magnified by fire-sales. This might occur if investors have been betting on continued price gains due to monetary policy support, and if liquidity were to dry up, as it has tended to do in recent times when there has been market stress. Reduced liquidity in bond markets under stress reflects a decline in the capacity and willingness of dealers to engage in market-making, the rise of algorithmic trading (BIS, 2016a) and the increase in government bond holdings of central banks. The snapback in bond yields would lead to a fall in other asset prices, due to a higher discount rate and risk aversion, and to exchange rate moves.</p>

The prolonged period of low growth and interest rates has challenged the business models of financial institutions. Persistent low profitability restrains banks’ capital accumulation and may, in turn, reduce financial intermediation or raise the cost of bank credit. Insufficient capital buffers could also discourage banks from recognising losses from NPLs. Weakened solvency of pension funds and insurance companies could have negative effects on other parts of the financial sector and undermine overall confidence. These institutions are closely interconnected with banks and asset managers, and are important investors in corporate bonds.</p>

In the United States, the increase was smaller but the ratio has been at a similar level.</p></fnote> Moreover, the results of recent stress tests in the euro area, Japan and the United States generally indicate improved resilience to significant negative shocks, with higher initial capital ratios, and capital falling below the required minimum in fewer banks than in previous tests (European Bank Authority, 2016; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2016; Bank of Japan, 2016). US bank equity prices have increased since the beginning of the year, especially after the US elections, boosting the equity price to book ratio to well above one. In contrast, despite their recent increase in the euro area and Japan, bank equity prices still remain between 30% and 65% below mid-2015 levels, underperforming non-financial companies (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID15c2d602-6981-4453-9e4c-ba25297bf7e2"/>). Consequently, the ratio of banks’ equity price to book value is still close to levels last seen during the financial market turbulence in 2009 and 2012.

Over recent years, returns on assets have been below the pre-crisis levels in the main OECD areas, with such returns significantly lower in the euro area and Japan than in the United States (IMF, 2016). In the euro area, although the estimated average return on equity for significant banks has picked up since the turn of the year, it is still subdued and remains significantly below the estimated cost of capital (Constâncio, 2016). Returns on equity of many banks are also below the estimated cost of equity in Japan (IMF, 2016). Several factors have challenged bank profitability, with their relative importance appearing to be country specific.<fnote id="ID94ed3ab9-84de-46ca-8c35-40188452eb63"><p id="IDd75ebee5-cc04-4f1a-9b86-95f3bc42e6c3" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">They include flattening of the yield curve (Borio et al., 2015; Claessens et al., 2016); negative returns on government securities and on reserves held at central banks in many European countries and Japan (Box 1.2 in OECD, 2016c); changing bank regulation (IMF, 2016); and fines and penalties for misdeeds in the past.</p></fnote> Some euro area countries, notably Italy, have still high non-performing loans (NPLs) (<xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID4bf7e0e2-d486-4bba-b316-457a692cee35"/> in <xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID9780a28d-0a5d-4904-b299-616f5fdba9fa"/>). NPLs require higher provisions, which in turn reduce net income, and they generally do not generate income (Aiyar et al., 2015). The ensuing deterioration of banks’ balance sheet positions can also raise borrowing costs for banks and reduce profitability even further. Moreover, high NPLs may slow the
reallocation of resources and thus productivity growth (Adelet McGowan et al., 2016), with a possible negative feedback on the economy and the banking sector. </p>

Low growth of GDP and wages translates into low growth in the financial resources available to fulfil pension promises. In practice, PAYG pension promises tend to be expressed in terms of replacement rates, the percentage of the wages that workers will receive when they retire. This implies that lower wage growth does not necessarily undermine the PAYG system as both revenues into the system and benefits paid out are reduced. By contrast, lower employment growth would weaken the system by reducing the number of workers paying in relative to the number of pensioners. Some systems have mechanisms to adjust the replacement rate depending on these factors.</p>
                  <p id="IDf6525e9b-8ea8-4d98-94d7-0d748894f9a0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">For funded pensions, the impact of low interest rates and low growth is more direct (OECD, 2015c). For defined contribution (DC) pensions, prolonged low interest rates reduce long-term returns. DC pensions do not have fixed liabilities, so the effect is limited to reducing the amount of assets accumulated and annuity providers will increase their premia. While this does not affect the sustainability of the pension funds, it does reduce the amount of assets accumulated and retirement income that the same pot of money can buy (OECD, 2016d).</p>
                  <p id="ID-42-1184879" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Defined benefit (DB) pension funds promise retirement income to pensioners, backed by a pool of funds. On the asset side, lower interest rates raise the current value of assets, but those bonds will mature and need to be replaced with bonds with lower yields. At the same time, low interest rates tend to increase the value of funds’ liabilities. As with PAYG schemes, occupational pensions often target a given replacement rate and so depend also on the evolution of wages. A further difficulty is that the duration of fund liabilities tends to be larger than for assets, so lower interest rates increase liabilities more than assets. The adverse effect of low interest rates is higher when the liabilities consist of promised fixed investment returns, such as annuities. If DB funds are backed by corporate sponsors or governments, lower interest rates can increase their exposures.</p>
                  <p id="ID-42-1184884" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The extent to which different individuals, institutions and countries are affected by these factors depends on their reliance on the various pension arrangements (figure below). It also depends on how long interest rates will remain low and developments in wages and employment. These additional pressures add to long standing challenges across many types of pension arrangements related to rising longevity and associated risks. A lower income environment reduces the room for manoeuvre to address these issues.</p>

With their long-term outlook, pension funds tend to act as market stabilisers (Bikker et al., 2010; Bank of England, 2014). However, pension funds may become less stabilising through herd-like behaviour to address the challenge of low returns. One risk is that, while searching for yields, they acquire illiquid assets that could be more prone to negative shocks and fire-sales. Pension funds already had exposures to alternative investments of more than $6 trillion, i.e. around 25% of total assets, as of end-2015 (OECD, 2016d).</p>

A central dilemma is how to strengthen the sustainability of pensions without at the same time raising saving and demand for risk-free assets, thereby worsening the underlying problem of low interest rates and low growth. This may lead to a tension between the individual interest of the pension scheme and the stability of the financial system. Strengthening near and long-term GDP growth prospects, leading to higher interest rates, would help to ease this tension.</p>
            <p id="ID2078bf0d-7109-4ca0-85ad-423e3a6c8b57" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">For pay-as-you-go pensions, the policies needed to restore sound financing include lowering promises and raising contribution rates or effective retirement ages. In many countries, gradually raising the effective retirement age in line with gains in life expectancy – which would also increase GDP – should be a key part of the solution.</p>
            <p id="ID662b7c0e-716f-4879-8471-36ec9362db93" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">For DB schemes, it is essential to adjust the promises in new contracts and to future retirees to reflect the fact that interest rates are unlikely to return fully to past norms, which may necessitate raising contributions and premia. The adjustment of retirement promises also needs to reflect changes in other actuarial parameters such as life expectancy. It may also be necessary to modify contracts and conditions for existing retirees. Several countries, including the Netherlands, have already given pension funds some discretion over the level of indexation of pension promises. In some cases this allows them to adjust accrued benefits. In exceptional circumstances, insurers and pension funds may need to renegotiate or adjust existing contracts and promises. Additionally, in the case of DB pension funds, pension-plan sponsors – and where relevant, plan members – could increase contributions to the pension fund to compensate for any shortfall.</p>
            <p id="IDc005dbc4-24b6-42c1-a50d-7aace59a60cd" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Supervisors of DB pensions should step up monitoring. Policymakers face a difficult balance between putting excessive pressure on institutions to correct funding deficits, which could aggravate the low growth and low interest rate environment at a time of market weakness, and regulatory forbearance. Requirements to maintain certain funding ratios, as well as the marking-to-market of asset values, may force pension funds to reduce risk at the wrong time and become pro-cyclical. Several countries have already allowed pension funds to have flexibility in meeting funding requirements (e.g. the Netherlands, Ireland, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom and the United States). The new OECD Core Principles on Private Pension Regulation provides a framework to address these issues.</p>
            <p id="ID7eb01e0a-df61-4251-a80b-8408d263486d" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Policymakers need to assess these risks carefully because there are potentially large consequences for future retirement incomes, pension funds and insurers, and ultimately public finances. The United Kingdom and the United States have government arrangements to protect pension funds, but pension challenges could also require government actions in other countries as well. It is also important to maintain public confidence in pension systems to encourage saving for old age and the stability of the institutions. In countries where defined-contribution arrangements are the main source for financing retirement (e.g. Australia, Chile, Mexico and New Zealand), concerns about the sustainability and adequacy of promised retirement income may lead to doubts about the design of current pension systems.</p>

The credit-to-GDP ratio relative to trend is now the highest among 43 advanced and emerging market economies and has reached levels observed in countries that experienced financial crises in the past (BIS, 2016b). The high pace of debt accumulation was sustained despite weaker domestic demand growth. This raises concerns about the underlying quality of new credit, disorderly corporate defaults and the possible extent to which it has been used to support financial asset prices. Residential property prices in some of the largest cities have risen by over 30% year-on-year, although price growth in smaller cities has been much more modest. The price gains have been partly driven by loose monetary policy and ample credit availability as well as reduced land supply. Non-financial corporations, with debt equal to 166% of GDP, face increasing challenges in servicing debt amid slowing growth, weak producer price inflation and overcapacity in several sectors. While the recent programme of debt-for-equity swaps will reduce the leverage of non‑financial corporations, the banking sector will be burdened with the costs, undermining their profitability, at a time when NPLs are already rising.</p>
          <p id="IDd6fe9d4b-779e-4033-9962-ed6dd5d720f9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In many other EMEs, private credit has also grown rapidly, with risks to financial stability and economic growth, though it has moderated recently (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID59210a69-115a-4228-afa1-a390ce7583bd"/>). Credit growth has been fuelled by favourable financial conditions amid low interest rates in advanced economies. Overall, capital inflows have diminished over the past two years in many EMEs, especially portfolio capital, but they still remain sizeable and are estimated to have risen considerably during the third quarter of 2016. Consequently, private debt-to-GDP ratios have reached high levels. At the beginning of 2016, credit to the non-financial private sector was above 70% of GDP in Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Turkey, and above 137% of GDP in Malaysia. Rapid private credit growth is one of the key factors raising the risks of recessions, as are large foreign capital debt inflows (de Serres and Gori, forthcoming).</p>

Conditional on the assumption of additional fiscal measures being implemented in the United States, the US policy interest rate is assumed to rise from 0.5% at present to 2% by end-2018 with a somewhat greater increase in 10-year bond yields. Policy rates are assumed to remain unchanged at current levels in Japan and the euro area.

This could involve raising capital surcharges for long-standing NPLs. The resolution will be also facilitated by a development of a market for such assets and an establishment of asset management companies (AMCs), possibly at the European level. Under current regulation, selling non-performing assets above market price to a state-supported AMC is regarded as state aid and triggers the bailing-in of creditors, including retail customers who own bank bonds. Since this hinders restructuring of NPLs, an EU‑wide agreement should be sought either not to trigger the bail-in procedure or to adopt a more lenient definition of market price levels that trigger state aid in those countries where NPLs are high and create a serious economic disturbance. An alternative strategy that would quickly clean balance sheets is to allow low-priced asset sales to private AMCs with options sold to the state to take advantage of the upside potential of such fire-sales. Regardless, insolvency procedures, which are unduly long in many countries, should be shortened, for instance, by resorting to out-of-court procedures. In view of international experience, this would reduce the costs of restructuring (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDc806db21-bdf8-4fc1-a374-bc9b5e5f6c3a"/>).</p>

Over recent years, the Federal Reserve has returned almost all of its gross interest income to the US government, accounting for just below ¼ of total central government interest expenses. In the United Kingdom, almost all of the 24.1 billion pounds that the Asset Purchase Facility Fund accumulated from interest income was transferred to the UK government in 2014 (around 9% of government interest expenses since 2009; 1.5% of 2014 GDP). </p></fnote> With the fall in market interest rates exceeding the fall in potential output growth between 2014‑16, the estimated debt limits at which governments lose market access have also risen, by more than 20% of GDP in some countries.</p>

Renewed efforts are needed across a wide range of reform areas after the slowdown in the pace of structural reforms in both advanced and emerging market economies in recent years. It is particularly important to ensure that reform efforts are coherent; otherwise they will not yield improved outcomes. For example, relaxing labour regulations in an environment of rigid product markets may only reduce employment and wages. In contrast, deregulating the business environment at the same time enhances the likelihood that businesses will compete for workers. However, the recent implementation of recommended reform packages has been uneven; reforms have been undertaken in either labour or product markets, but infrequently undertaken in both areas (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID7441e337-f0b4-48bf-8b98-63d7f59c43ff"/>).

A first set of trade policy priorities is to avoid new trade protectionist measures that reduce market access, alongside steps to roll back the protectionist measures introduced since the crisis. All advanced and emerging market economies could also boost trade and productivity by reducing unnecessary trade costs through improvements to border and customs procedures, removing tariff and non-tariff barriers, removing regulatory restrictions on trade in services, particularly logistics, and harmonising costly regulations between countries. Tackling impediments and distortions to cross border investment, including in the euro area (Fournier, 2015) would also contribute to trade by encouraging FDI and a better integration into global value chains. </p>

Where government plans have been announced but not legislated, they are incorporated if it is deemed clear that they will be implemented in a shape close to that announced. For the United States, with the fiscal programme of the incoming Administration yet to be announced, the projections assume an increase in the underlying primary deficit of ¼ per cent of GDP in 2017 and 1¼ per cent in 2018, primarily due to reduced taxes. Elsewhere, where there is insufficient information to determine budget outcomes, the underlying primary balances are kept unchanged, implying no discretionary change in the fiscal stance; in euro area countries, the stated targets in Stability Programmes are also used.</p>

Possible weaknesses in the real economy are captured by the difference between the potential and the actual GDP growth rate, the difference between the actual unemployment rate and the sustainable rate of unemployment (or NAIRU), the current account deficit and the evolution of relative unit labour costs. Indicators of financial market excesses related to the non-financial sector are the debt of households and non-financial corporations and real house price growth.

Vulnerabilities stemming from the public sector are quantified along three dimensions: government net borrowing, gross government debt and the difference between 10-year real sovereign bond yields and the potential real GDP growth rate. Higher values, with the exception of the leverage ratio, indicate a larger vulnerability. <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID4bf7e0e2-d486-4bba-b316-457a692cee35"/> also includes the current sovereign credit ratings issued by Standard and Poor’s.</p>

        <p id="IDcb38667f-3abc-4787-9200-937f9da3a6bb" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Almost a decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis, the global economy remains in a low-growth trap with weak investment, trade, productivity and wage growth and rising inequality in some countries. Monetary policy is overburdened, leading to growing financial risks and distortions. Alongside structural reforms, a stronger fiscal policy response is needed to boost near-term growth and strengthen long-term prospects for inclusive growth.</p>
        <p id="IDb44927ba-c08f-4ff5-9ff4-522ac806f2ff" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">However, in the context where public debt has reached high levels in most OECD countries, it is important to assess the extent of countries' fiscal space and the temporary deficit increase they can afford to run. In the past few years, the assessment of fiscal policy has focused essentially on public budget balance positions rather than on the consequences for growth. This focus has resulted in a higher debt-to-GDP ratio in the short term through shortfalls in investment, human capital and productivity. A rethink is needed for how the fiscal policy stance should be evaluated, particularly in the context where very low sovereign interest rates provide more fiscal space.</p>

Measures should be chosen depending on each country's most pressing needs and could include not only raising soft and hard infrastructure or education spending, but also cutting harmful taxes. In many countries, such a package could be deficit-financed for a few years, before turning budget-neutral. Combining this initiative with structural reforms will enhance the output gains.</p>

Other things being equal, low interest rates increase the amount of <shortcitation>fiscal space</shortcitation> – a measure of how much governments can borrow without losing market access or facing sustainability challenges. This shifts the perceived trade-off between borrowing to support growth and consolidation, making it possible in some countries to borrow more without undermining sustainability.

This continues a long trend of declining nominal and real yields over past decades, which has been compounded by very low or even negative policy rates and large-scale central bank purchases at long maturities, as well as the reduction in the term premium following changes in banking regulations. In the euro area, declining risk spreads since the 2011-12 crisis have contributed to lower borrowing costs. At the same time, many governments have used the opportunity to extend the maturity of outstanding debt, locking in low rates (OECD, 2016). Nominal yields are also at relatively low levels in many EMEs compared with past experience, while EME interest rates remain typically well above those in advanced economies, commensurate with their growth and inflation prospects.</p>

Looking forward, and partially accounting for the maturity structure of public debt, further reduction in interest costs are likely if yields remain around the current level as old debt at higher yields matures. This would lead to significant additional savings, notably in Italy and to a lesser extent in France and the United Kingdom over the period 2015-17, under the assumption that 15% of the initial stock of debt is rolled over each year and the rest is valued at an implicit rate that captures the maturity structure of the debt (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5fbf9a55-c843-4a71-a88c-74462fdfe614"/>).

At first glance, fiscal space appears to be a relatively intuitive concept and can be defined as the <shortcitation>room in a government's budget that allows it to provide resources for a desired purpose without jeopardizing the sustainability of its financial position or the stability of the economy</shortcitation> (Heller, 2005).</p>
            <p id="ID8f0245fb-e33d-4427-9940-fb8282d29309" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">However, there is no consensus on the way fiscal space should be measured. On one side, there is uncertainty about the extent to which the government is facing the risk to be unable to roll over debt anymore. The fiscal space can be thought of as the difference between the current debt level and the debt limit at which the government would lose <emphasis emph="italic">market access</emphasis>. On the other side, fiscal space can be defined in terms of long-term <emphasis emph="italic">fiscal sustainability</emphasis>. In practice, the conclusions from these two approaches can differ. For instance, a country with an expected marked rise in public spending on ageing and health can have fiscal space according to the former approach, but none according to the latter. These two aspects of fiscal space are sometimes interrelated, as long-term sustainability considerations often affect market access through risk premia. However, it is difficult to comprehensively capture all the factors affecting fiscal space with a single method, and therefore empirical studies usually predominantly focus on either market access or long‑term sustainability (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID1fb6482b-b9f6-4520-b449-4868806f9999"/>).</p>

Quantitative analysis can only build on assumptions on how households and businesses would react in the future should higher debt levels be reached. As a result, debt limits and resulting fiscal space estimates should be used with care and uncertainties surrounding such estimates underlined. In real life, debt limits have to account for many factors, including the level and trajectory of public debt, financing needs, fiscal track record, economic development, market sentiment and macroeconomic shocks. However, as statistical methods usually have to be parsimonious, the best option is to rely on a range on methods to get a full assessment. Rather than pointing to a precise point estimate, these complementary analyses help in understanding the key mechanisms at work.</p>

This chapter relies essentially on three (see <xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDb02a27d3-7dc8-4319-9f0a-541ac7096b24"/> for an overview of the different methods used in this chapter), with the objective of approaching the complex reality from different angles:</p>

They calculate fiscal space as the distance between actual debt levels and their estimated limits, measured as the debt level at which a sovereign borrower loses market access and hence cannot service its debt in a normal way. Debt limits depend on assumptions made on risk-free interest rates and potential output growth, the size of shocks that hit economies, the country's fiscal track record and the fiscal reaction to increasing debt. The fiscal reaction relies on the assumption that governments cannot indefinitely sustain public primary surpluses and will experience fiscal fatigue at some point. The model includes a non-linear risk premium that rises sharply if debt becomes close to the debt limit.</p>

Shocks to the economy and long-term projections of spending and transfers are accounted for. The approach does not compute a point estimate of the debt limit, but its distribution, i.e. the probability for a country to default at each value of the debt-to-GDP ratio. This distribution is derived using the expected present value of future maximum primary surpluses, where the latter comes from driving tax revenues to the peak of the Laffer curve and expenditure to its projected level. </p>

(1990) focus essentially on <emphasis emph="italic">long-term fiscal sustainability</emphasis> in the context where the interest rate is above the economic growth rate. When the interest rate is persistently below the growth rate, governments are able to run permanent deficits of any size. When the differential between the interest rate and growth is positive, fiscal space is computed as the tax gap between the sustainable and the current tax-to-GDP rate, where the former is the constant tax rate that would achieve an unchanged debt-to-GDP ratio over the relevant horizon, for a given projection of public spending and transfers. In this chapter, a variant of this methodology is used: sustainable tax rates are recomputed using the FM model (see <xref object="annex" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDd38e5ec3-d3d6-4240-8e06-0ca535bbff40"/>), whereby part of health spending is categorised as an investment. </p>

The market access method assumes that a lender of last resort prevents any self‑fulfilling crisis. In practice, institutions do not always guarantee this, and a self-fulfilling crisis can crucially depend on other parameters, such as the debt maturity structure and the share of debt issued in foreign currency. The approach based on Laffer curves does not take into account possible political economy considerations associated with driving tax revenues to the peak of the Laffer curve or with adjusting government spending instead. The approach based on Blanchard et al. (1990), on the other hand, does not take macroeconomic shocks into account. Therefore, this chapter does not rely on any one single approach, but rather treats them as illustrative. Consequently, the main focus of the analysis is not on precise numerical estimates of fiscal space, but rather on the trends and underlying mechanism at work.</p>

The magnitude of the estimated increase in fiscal space varies widely across countries. It was above 20% of GDP in seven OECD countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom. However, it is estimated to have perceptibly narrowed in Finland and Korea, due to the large fall in potential output and the relatively small decline in real interest rates, but significant space remains.</p>

A typical OECD country is indeed going to see its age-related spending, including pension and health care costs, rise dramatically over the next 30 years. At the same time, countries can maximise their tax revenues. As discussed above, a simple way to approach this is to make use of a Laffer curve, which will determine the maximum revenue a typical country can collect, given its characteristics and the state of the economy. If economies were not subject to shocks, the combination of such spending and revenues would define a debt limit. However, uncertainty in the economy means that there is no fixed threshold for debt that, when crossed, triggers sovereign default.</p>

Assuming the differentials between growth and interest rates gradually converge to their long-term average, the long-term measure of fiscal space, based on Blanchard et al. (1990) and OECD pension spending projections, point to limited sustainability risks over the long term in the three main euro area economies (OECD, 2015a). However, health spending is expected to rise markedly over the next decades as the population ages (de la Maisonneuve and Oliveira Martins, 2015). Accounting for these projected increases in health costs, large advanced economies will have to adjust their tax ratios and/or spending by several percentage points of GDP to stabilise debt at current levels by 2060. The pace of this adjustment will depend to a large extent on the speed at which real interest rates become aligned to output growth. Locking in the very low levels of interest rates by issuing more long-dated bonds would help manage the interest-rate risk.</p>

This would help countries regain some fiscal room, even when taking into account that some of the health spending is investment that contributes to future output, as the effect on the budget balance would dominate the effect on potential output (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID615513c0-5a07-47ec-a466-d99d242b5631"/>).

Further reforms in this direction will also raise fiscal space. Whereas low growth of aggregate productivity can add to pension sustainability pressures (see Chapter 1), reforms that increase the retirement age allow contribution rates and replacement rates to be maintained, while also contributing to sizeable output gains (Johansson and Fournier, 2016). Finally, by raising potential output, product and labour market reforms will also increase the fiscal space available to governments.</p>

Such a programme could include high-quality spending on education, health and research and development as well as green infrastructure that all bring significant output gains in the long run and foster inclusiveness. The question is to what extent such a stimulus could be financed by issuing long-term bonds, without endangering long-term fiscal sustainability.</p>

It also identifies the factors that can help maximise the growth impact of such an initiative. Those impacts will vary over time (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID5dd3d8d4-7305-43df-8bc3-7aac4d6b840b"/>). Indeed, high returns on capital, the persistence of long-term unemployment and the implementation of structural reforms will have an impact that increases over time, while the effect of acting collectively and of financing the initiative through higher public deficit in the short term will dissipate over time. These different factors are described in more details in the following sections.</p>

          <p id="IDaeee031a-316b-4ae9-92fc-b76cad6f4f0e" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A productivity-enhancing fiscal initiative can be financed temporarily by issuing debt. Taking the example of public investment, simulations suggest that the number of years during which a country can finance a permanent ½ per cent of GDP fiscal initiative by increasing its deficit ranges between 1 year in Korea to 6 years in Ireland or the United Kingdom (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDfac65c98-0314-4cb6-adf6-54dfaf8374a9"/>). The intuition behind this is that the fiscal initiative can raise output more than it increases debt, reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="CHDCDIBG"/>). The magnitude of this fiscal initiative is close to the average of the annual increase in public investment observed over the past decades in OECD countries in the years when public investment increased (0.6 % of GDP). In the simulation, the number of years is calculated so that the public debt level remained unchanged in 2040. This number is a function of the country's initial level of the public capital stock and of the differential between economic growth and the interest rate, as well as the initial level of public debt. According to this analysis, Japan is found to have no room to finance a fiscal initiative through higher deficit.</p>

on the debt-to-GDP ratio</mainhead>
              </heading>
              <p id="ID-42-1128762" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Debt-financed public investment has two long-term effects on the debt-to-GDP ratio: it increases the debt level as the government borrows more, and it raises the denominator as potential GDP is increased by hard or soft public investment and business investment is boosted. The government can choose how long to run the deficit so that the debt increase is just offset by the GDP increase. This depends on the difference between the return of the public investment (which is captured here with the positive effect of public investment on GDP) and the interest rate paid by the government.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1128767" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">This is illustrated here with a stylised scenario in which the government increases public investment relative to GDP permanently, against a no-policy change baseline scenario with constant ratio of public investment to GDP and with the primary deficit following an agreed plan. The long-term debt-to-GDP ratio in the baseline scenario is reported in the figure below (dashed line, no-policy action).</p>
              <p id="ID814bda5f-083f-465b-b39b-50e544aaff20" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In a first scenario, it is assumed that public investment is financed by cuts in current spending or by tax increases. In this scenario, public borrowing is unchanged, while the denominator is increased on account of the different multipliers on the investment versus current spending versus taxes: the debt-to-GDP ratio declines. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio is 2 percentage points below the no-policy action scenario (triangle in the figure below). In a second scenario, investment is deficit-financed for a given number of years, and government borrowing will increase with the number of years, as illustrated by the solid line in the figure below. In this second scenario, it is assumed that it takes time to restrain current spending or to reap the benefits of public investment in terms of higher tax revenues. As the figure illustrates, there is a break-even duration of investment for which the debt-to-GDP ratio is equal to the one with the no-policy change scenario (circle in the figure below).</p>
              <p id="ID3ec7a34d-1a8e-4a73-9e8e-3249b1d5e1a9" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">This break-even number of years depends on the effect of public investment on potential GDP. Should the government identify higher-quality projects and activities, the number of years of deficit-financing could be even greater. This is most likely the case in countries where public investment decreased during the crisis, or where the public capital stock is relatively low. Structural reforms that increase GDP can also provide room for longer-lasting deficits. Last, the break-even number of years depends on the level of the debt-to-GDP ratio itself: it is all the more crucial that the portfolio of changes to the fiscal budget increases GDP in the most indebted countries. For instance, a policy that increases GDP by one per cent while leaving the debt level unchanged would decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio by one percentage point if the debt-to-GDP ratio is 100%; it would decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio by only one-half of a percentage point if the debt-to-GDP ratio is 50%.</p>
              <p id="ID44824246-c2f2-4198-b235-7f29e04c05ed" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">This stylised exercise considers gross debt: it ignores public real assets. This is a prudent simplification: the number of years during which investment-led stimulus can be deficit-financed would be higher if one replaces gross debt by net debt in the analysis. A permanent increase in public investment implies a permanent increase in the capital stock that decreases net debt.</p>

          <p id="ID9e65c971-3e04-4245-a8a6-5d348e5ff652" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A productivity-enhancing fiscal initiative has not only a short-term demand effect but also a longer-term supply effect, in contrast with boosting current public expenditure. Public investment is an example of such a fiscal measure. To the extent that monetary policy is constrained, an investment-led stimulus may raise output more than it increases debt, leading to a fall in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the short term. This will likely be the case if public investment manages to catalyse private investment. In the long term, the boost in investment increases the productive capacity of the economy and the positive effect on potential output leads in additional tax revenues. Whether higher investment increases or lowers the debt-to-GDP ratio in the long term will depend on a number of factors, including the extent to which potential output is boosted. In all cases, the long-term effect of a public investment shock on the debt ratio will be more favourable than a public consumption shock that does not raise the productive capacity of economies.</p>
          <p id="IDd61ddd31-f4fc-43c1-b902-8230b4ceaa5f" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Strong institutions and effective public governance are key for a successful fiscal initiative. This includes respect for the rule of law, quality regulation, transparency, openness and integrity. Whole-of-government approaches will improve outcomes and enhance the use of public resources. Fiscal policy is intertwined with a lot of other public policies – like competitiveness, climate-change mitigation, managing demographic change and innovation – and their effective combination can bring about synergies (OECD, 2015b). Regarding public investment specifically, good governance and reliable <emphasis emph="italic">ex ante</emphasis> assessment of projects’ social rates of return are crucial to ensure that high returns materialise and to prevent the cost overruns and over-estimation of future demand that have occurred in a number of past infrastructure projects (Persson and Song, 2010). More generally, regulation and other framework conditions, including access to markets and pricing regimes, will also affect the return on investment (Sutherland et al., 2011). Evidence suggests that most OECD countries still have room to improve their existing regulatory framework to ensure that regulation is fit for purpose and achieves its goals (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID0f08b5df-2930-4d72-abac-19f0a7a7a652"/>, OECD, 2015c).</p>

While there is evidence that the returns depend on institutional factors, such as the quality of project selection and the regulatory and operational frameworks, public investment is likely to have high returns in countries where the initial stock of public capital and investment is low (Fournier, 2016). The effect on output would be, amongst the large advanced economies, above average in Germany and the United Kingdom, where the stock of public capital is estimated to be relatively low (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID8eb052ef-871a-4c34-ae0a-d4c5f4bcc79a"/>). On the other hand, the output gains could be very negative for Japan, reflecting a large initial public capital stock and associated low and even negative rates of return at the margin for conventionally-defined public capital. The long-term elasticity of capital to potential output and the depreciation rates determine the extent to which the additional public investment will accumulate into productive capacity. These parameters have been calibrated using results reported in the economic literature. For instance, a meta-study by Bom and Ligthard (2014) suggests, that the elasticity of investment in core infrastructure, such as roads, rails and telecommunications on long-term output could be relatively high. In particular, spillovers from the higher public capital stock on potential output have been estimated to be positive for infrastructure spending in the United States and in the European Union (White House, 2016; European Commission, 2014).</p>

The 2% gains in long-term output are conditional on the assumption that the stimulus is financed after three to four years through an increase in non-distortionary taxes or a cut in other spending, with neither of these factors affecting potential output. Alternative assumptions, such as financing a stimulus through an increase in direct taxes on households, which reduces household disposable income and spending, would lower this impact.</p>

In recent years, the pace of structural reforms in both advanced and EMEs has slowed. This slowdown is particularly troubling for long-term growth prospects. Actions across a broad range of reform objectives, such as product market competition, labour mobility and financial market robustness are essential in order to reverse the widespread slowdown in productivity and improve inclusiveness.</p>

Simulations suggest that the output gains of a fiscal initiative could be lower by some 0.3 percentage point on average compared to a scenario where the fiscal initiative is combined with a 10% reduction in the regulatory burden as captured by OECD indicators (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDe00394c2-31cf-416f-99fe-a2a77b17b886"/>).</p>

Its effect on total factor productivity has been derived from Bourls et al. (2010), where total factor productivity depends on institutions and the distance to the frontier country (the United States). Structural reforms are also assumed to increase the speed of adjustment of the economy following a shock. For illustrative purposes, the adjustment speed has been doubled when structural reforms are implemented. The possible broader effects of such a reform on employment and the capital stock have been omitted, suggesting possible over-estimation of the impact of the reform in the short term. Also, the budgetary costs of reforms are not considered, as the latter are hard to quantify.</p>

While the focus is mainly on GDP and government balances, there could also be important distributional consequences, with some reforms affecting certain household groups more than others. A reduction in barriers to competition has been found to lift incomes of the lower-middle class more than GDP per capita, pointing to some synergies between growth and equity (Causa et al., 2015).</p>

          <p id="ID44c989ce-d4fe-486c-9a27-246134f368de" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The current economic environment is characterised by a low-growth trap with weak demand investment, productivity and trade. In such an environment, demand effects lead to permanent supply-side effects through the process of hysteresis, which changes the dynamics of labour demand and of capital investment through insiders/outsiders effects (Blanchard and Summers, 1987; Lindbeck and Snower, 1988) or skill losses (Pissarides, 1992). This in turn has persistent negative effects on supply (Delong and Summers, 2012). The existence of hysteresis in a weak economy leads to stronger long-term output gains from stimulus. The magnitude of the gains depends on the initial position in the cycle and, to a lesser extent, on the degree of labour market rigidity. They are estimated to be particularly important for France and Italy (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID90242e2b-110f-4db2-96d0-1630b2b1801e"/>). They are also likely to be particularly marked in Southern European countries where demand has been depressed for an extended period of time.</p>

For instance, an investment-led fiscal stimulus is found to have a stronger long-term effect on the output level of about ½ percentage point in France and Italy than it would be in the absence of labour market hysteresis. The differences are smaller, of by around ¼ percentage point, in the United States and Canada. Starting from an output gap that is close to zero, the United Kingdom does not benefit from additional output gains when hysteresis is taken into account.</p>

Demand spillovers, whereby policy action in one country influences investment and export flows with partner economies (Barrell et al., 2012), are found to be significant in the case of synchronised fiscal stimulus (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2014). In addition to these traditional channels, knowledge spillovers, resulting from the international diffusion of innovations and higher trade levels, will raise the benefits to other countries from higher innovation in each economy. While the knowledge spillovers are less important in the short term, they play a role in the long term. </p>

For example, the number of OECD countries which simultaneously injected a sustained large public investment stimulus was around four per year on average in the pre-crisis period, and in general these were not coordinated. By contrast, more than 15 countries markedly increased public investment spending in 2008 and 17 did so in 2009.</p>

Countries where fiscal space is limited also have room to move toward a mix that is more supportive of inclusive growth. Productive spending has a permanent effect on the supply side of the economy, while unproductive spending has a short-lived effect. Likewise, the tax structure can be modified to support inclusive growth. The composition of the fiscal initiative is thus essential for fiscal expansion to be undertaken without increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio in the long run. </p>

These gains are particularly strong in fields that are associated with large externalities, such as health (e.g. hospitals, medical equipment and prevention). A spending shift towards public investment and away from other spending in less advanced economies would also speed up their convergence with the most advanced economies, provided that good governance is in place. As discussed above, the growth gains from increasing public investment may decline at a high level of the public capital stock due to decreasing returns. Still, estimations suggest that all OECD countries but Japan have room for additional public investment. Overall, such a spending shift would lift <shortcitation>all boats</shortcitation> as it raises average income without any adverse equity effects. Targeted additional capital spending can also help achieve long-term objectives such as those related to climate change and environmental quality.</p>

The countries which benefit the most from the reform are those where reforms would yield gains of more than 10% of GDP. For family benefits, the table shows countries where the reform would increase the income of the poor by more than 20%. </p>

          <p id="IDb9359395-ed15-4bfe-b045-c0980e920e0f" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Output gains from increased public spending on research and development are potentially large, particularly if spending is directed to basic research where widespread market failures lead to under‑investment by the private sector (OECD, 2015c). Higher public spending on basic research can also enhance the ability of economies to learn from innovations at the global frontier (Saia et al., 2015).</p>
          <p id="ID6f3299b7-7b92-42e3-87e2-561597e810f2" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Recent evidence based on OECD countries suggests that increasing the quality of, and the time spent in, education yields large growth gains by raising skills and thereby productivity (Fournier and Johansson, 2016). In addition, an education reform that aims at encouraging completion of secondary education can decrease income inequality. This is in line with earlier research on the effect of education on earnings inequality: an increase in the share of upper-secondary degrees decreases labour earning inequality, while an increase in the share of tertiary degrees increases inequality in education outcomes and hence can increase earnings inequality (Fournier and Koske, 2012). </p>
          <p id="IDc4d79a25-7f4f-496c-a258-e5744cf9aff1" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Shifting spending towards family benefits and childcare and away from other spending also decreases income inequality. This may also facilitate the participation of second earners in the labour market and will help the social inclusion of children from more deprived backgrounds. In the long run, these spending reforms could be funded by cutting public subsidies and raising the retirement age, as pensions and subsidies can have adverse effects on growth. Subsidy cuts that yield disproportionately greater gains for the rich than the poor can be complemented by other redistributive policies that reduce inequality. </p>
          <p id="ID3e9d04ff-3885-4f58-b796-ed5a2f3f803c" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Turning to revenues, shifting part of the revenue base from personal and corporate income taxes to less distortive taxes such as recurrent taxes on immovable property or consumption would boost growth (Johansson et al., 2008; <xref object="table" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDfbfc9b10-1b9b-4091-8743-8ed98aecbd45"/>). However, such a tax shift would reduce the overall progressivity of the tax system as these taxes are less progressive than income taxes. Furthermore, a combination of base broadening and rate reduction of individual taxes can complement a revenue shift. </p>

For instance, public investment gains are the largest in countries with the lowest public capital stock, so that investment needs are the highest, and when it is targeted toward appropriate fields, such as research and development (Fournier, 2016). As regards education spending, sound education policies are key to improve outcomes (see Hanushek and Woessmann, 2011 for a literature review). For taxes, broadening the tax base while reducing the tax rate avoids tax-induced distortions (Johansson et al., 2008). Business investment can also be supported by a predictable and simple tax design.</p>

In particular, Austria, Hungary, Iceland, Norway and Spain have provided a fiscal stimulus of 1% of GDP or more in 2016. Amongst the large advanced economies, fiscal support in 2016 amounts to around ½ per cent of GDP in Canada, Germany and Italy. Country-specific assessments of the fiscal packages are set out in Chapter 3.</p>
        <p id="IDfd772698-f0c8-44bc-b502-c02181f382b0" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The likely shift towards more expansionary fiscal policy in the United States in coming years will provide support to economic growth, although the mix between tax cuts and spending may unduly favour tax cuts. However, in many OECD countries, fiscal policy could be more expansionary than currently planned. A few large economies, including Germany, should borrow more in the coming years to raise public investment more than currently envisaged. A fiscal initiative in the United Kingdom would help to manage the contractionary impact of Brexit. By contrast, in a few countries such as Hungary and Iceland, tighter policy stances would be preferable.</p>

In China, spending needs to be directed at the health and education sectors. In India, an increase in tax revenues and an improvement in spending efficiency will help regain fiscal room.</p>

Countries with no fiscal space would also benefit from raising the share of their productive spending and lowering the share of harmful taxes in total spending and taxes.</p>
        <p id="ID1149e193-13f7-43ba-ba7b-38582222e572" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Most OECD countries with increased fiscal space have room to significantly increase either high-quality public investment or spending on health or education. In particular, there is a need to repair existing infrastructure and carry out other maintenance in a number of countries. More spending toward quality childcare and early education spending is also warranted in a number of countries, including Germany and Italy. A few countries such as Denmark and France, where tax rates are elevated, should possibly rather focus on lowering labour and/or corporate taxes rather than increase spending.</p>

This is notably the case in China, India and Russia, but also in a few European countries, Italy in particular. In the European countries, it may be preferable to use the increase in fiscal space to clean up banks’ balance sheets and opt for a stimulus at the euro-area-wide rather than the national level, for instance through larger bond issuance by the European Investment Bank.</p>

The application of the EU Stability and Growth Pact could be modified to allow for a more supportive fiscal stance, for example by excluding net investment spending from fiscal rules and, more generally, developing a coherent approach for using discretion in applying fiscal rules (<xref object="box" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="ID-42-1133997"/>).</p>

            <p id="ID-42-1134012" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Making use of the increased fiscal space from exceptionally low interest rates to address low growth in the euro area is challenging in the context of the EU Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).<boxnoteref refid="ID9e9b766e-33bc-4700-a07c-b28a10e1b4e6" format="boxnoteref"/> This box considers two options, one temporary and the other permanent, to expand the fiscal space available to countries under the SGP without fundamental and difficult-to-achieve changes to the Pact’s architecture.</p>
            <p id="ID-42-1134017" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The rules of the SGP currently require the major euro area economies, with the exception of Germany, to pursue fiscal consolidation efforts of around 0.5 percentage point of GDP or higher each year. Under the <shortcitation>corrective arm</shortcitation>, a benchmark annual structural balance adjustment of at least 0.5% of GDP is typically required under the Excessive Deficit Procedure regardless of cyclical conditions for countries. In the <shortcitation>preventive arm</shortcitation>, for countries that have not reached their medium-term objective (MTO), a benchmark 0.5% of GDP annual structural balance adjustment is also required, although there is some limited scope to waive it, for example in the event of negative growth. In principle, the <shortcitation>1/20th of excess over 60% ceiling</shortcitation> debt reduction rule could here lead to much larger adjustments in countries with high debt. There is some flexibility under clauses for structural reforms and investment, as has been the case of Italy in 2016 but conditions are restrictive. </p>
            <p id="ID-42-1134052" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In practice, recommendations from the Council have often required annual adjustment of the structural balance in excess of 0.5% of GDP. However, incomplete compliance with these requirements has led – on the European Commission’s assessment – to less consolidation than required and a somewhat easier stance than the rules implied. </p>
            <p id="ID-42-1134057" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Current very low government yields in the euro area create additional fiscal space. If a fiscal expansion in this conjuncture were well-designed, with strong emphasis on high‑quality investment projects, debt-to-GDP ratios might not even increase and therefore fiscal sustainability would not be impaired.</p>
            <p id="ID-42-1134062" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The SGP rules make it difficult to use this additional fiscal space, both for countries currently in the EDP or who have not reached their MTOs, and can restrict policy for countries that currently meet the EU requirements. </p>
            <p id="ID-42-1134067" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">To achieve the most appropriate area-wide fiscal stance, some modulation is required in how the rules are applied. Two options are set out below, one temporary and the other permanent, to expand the room available to countries under the SGP without fundamental and difficult-to-achieve changes to the Pact’s architecture. </p>

              <p id="ID-42-1134084" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In practice current rules appear to be extremely complex, have been interpreted in a very <emphasis emph="italic">ad hoc</emphasis> way and, as a result, lack credibility. Indeed, the Council has full discretion as to whether a rule has been breached, whether to apply sanctions and whether to modify adjustment paths (OECD, 2014). There is some room for interpretation in the application of the rules, including the use of flexibility clauses. In practice, slippage relative to previous adjustment requirements has been common. For example, extensions of EDP deadlines have been allowed 18 times since 2009.</p>
              <p id="ID-42-1134093" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Rather than <emphasis emph="italic">ad hoc</emphasis> extensions and responding in a piecemeal way to fiscal developments, the Council could develop a coherent approach to the application of discretion in the current exceptional circumstances. This would make policy more predictable and could encourage governments to pursue medium-term plans based on spending with high multipliers. The new European Fiscal Board (EFB) could provide guidance on the approach.</p>

A number of small adjustments exist to take into account investment, but these are marginal.<boxnoteref refid="ID89980dd6-618a-47f3-a65c-1e858e55db38" format="boxnoteref"/></p>

This could, for example, be achieved by expanding the existing <shortcitation>investment clause</shortcitation> to cover all forms of (net) investment as defined in the national accounts and easing the conditions for its use. The clause should also apply in the corrective arm by broadening interpretation of structural reforms (European Commission, 2015). Such a move to a <shortcitation>golden rule</shortcitation> could be formalised on a permanent basis through deeper changes to the rules. Existing Eurostat rules and procedures would provide some safeguard against reclassification of spending towards investment, in part at the cost of focussing only on physical capital.</p>

There is also evidence of sizeable spillovers across countries (OECD, 2015e; In’t Veld, 2016). Furthermore, net public investment has been zero or negative in the main euro area economies in recent years. </p>
              <p id="ID05634f92-3297-4abe-8514-b20fbee34bde" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">These two options would help to use expanded fiscal space without fundamental changes to the EU SGP rules. There are a number of other potential issues with the EU rules in the current exceptional environment that would not be addressed by these options, including a possible exacerbation of measurement issues related to potential output whereby weak growth leads to a reduction in estimated potential output and narrows fiscal space. In addition, the change in circumstances since the numerical rules were calibrated would warrant careful re-consideration.</p>

Further, a country can use the clause only once until it reaches its MTO and only if its structural balance is within 1.5 percentage points of GDP of the MTO. In addition, the expenditure benchmark smoothes total investment expenditure over four years. In the corrective arm, the European Commission should take into account whether the deficit exceeds total investment expenditure, but no operational provisions have been defined for investment (with the exception of national contributions to the EFSI).</p>

Such a model-based approach also provides insights on the mechanisms at work when government debt is becoming large.</p>

More specifically, fiscal authorities are assumed to follow a fiscal reaction function, whereby the primary budget balance reacts to the public debt level and control variables:</p>

Estimates confirm that governments react weakly by increasing their primary balance when debt increases but remains below about 120% of GDP (d<sub>1</sub> in <xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDbcfeeee4-1485-4270-9b9d-9ee43e51cf92"/>).

Beyond this threshold, governments may abandon fiscal discipline and measure the primary deficit. Alternative estimates also capture the effect of the business cycle on the primary balance, and include additional control variables, such as asset prices, inflation, IMF programmes, the old age dependency ratio, the euro area or the government size.</p>

In most cases, a debt limit can be found, suggesting that the past behaviour is sustainable. In some other cases, no solution can be found, suggesting that under the assumption of unchanged behaviour, the public debt dynamic is not sustainable. One important feature of the approach is to underline that is that if the public debt of a country is quite close to its limit, a change in the macroeconomic environment can induce a shift into an unsustainable dynamic. Conversely, a change in government behaviour or an improvement in macroeconomic conditions can bring a country out of a sovereign stress situation.</p>

In practice, institutions do not always guaranty this, and a self‑fulfilling crisis can crucially depend on other parameters, such as the debt maturity structure and the share of debt issued in foreign currency. </p>

(1990) assess fiscal space by examining the tax gap, which is the difference between the sustainable and the actual tax rate. This gap can be computed at different horizons. A positive indicator points to the need for either increasing taxes or decreasing spending in the future. The indicator also measures the size of the required adjustment, under the assumption the adjustment is undertaken without delay.</p>

The assumption that the debt-to-GDP ratio converges to its initial level is less stringent than it could seem, as discounting means two different levels of the ratio far in the future imply nearly the same sustainable tax rate today.</p>

When the interest rate is persistently below the growth rate, governments are able to run permanent deficits of any size.</p>

Using the methodology described in Blanchard et al. (1990) and data from the latest Economic Outlook, two-year-ahead gaps appear to be negative in all the large advanced economies but Italy (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDb3940a50-de7f-4553-902b-e6576bda506d"/>). This result points to some fiscal space over the period 2016-17, reflecting essentially the negative interest rate to growth differential that is expected during that period. In such a situation, governments would no longer need to generate primary surpluses to achieve sustainability. Such a measure, however, faces the same limits as synthetic indicators in that it does not account for long-term developments in public spending.</p>

The sign of the gaps depends to a very large extent on the assumptions used to project health care spending, which are traditionally surrounded by large uncertainties, given the difficulty to estimate how technology affects costs. Measures taken to contain costs in the health sector are found to increase fiscal limits in all the countries considered. In the same vein, reforms that will restrain increase in pension spending will also increase fiscal space.</p>
            <p id="ID85623473-5cb6-4973-8dd8-efe277203b98" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">This method presents several advantages. It takes into account future developments of the economy and long-term spending projections. It is also tractable and relatively easy to communicate. Gaps can also be computed under a range of policy assumptions. However, in the current context of persistent low and negative interest rates, this approach loses some of its relevance. Finally, a major drawback is its reliance on specific assumptions, such as long-term spending on health care, which are surrounded by large uncertainties. </p>

Empirically those limits are derived from a DSGE framework. The fiscal limit is forward-looking and depends on expected future policies and how credible those policies are, private behaviour (consumption-saving and labour-leisure choices) and the fundamental shocks to the economy.</p>
            <p id="ID8d6fc56d-da91-47d4-941d-759252c9e309" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">In this approach, the fiscal limit arises endogenously from the economy's dynamic Laffer curve, whose shape depends on the state of the economy. The maximum debt level depends on the expected present value of future maximum primary surpluses. This is derived from driving tax revenues to the peak of the Laffer curve and driving expenditure and transfers to some expected levels. </p>

Output depends on the level of productivity and labour supply. Household consumption and government purchases satisfy the aggregate resource constraint. The gap between productivity and its steady state follows an autoregressive process of order 1. </p>

The government finances lump-sum transfers to households and unproductive purchases by collecting tax revenue through a tax on labour income and issuing one-period bonds. Lump-sum transfers are countercyclical and government purchases follow an autoregressive process of order 1. Following Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2007), the government increases tax rates when public debt rises. An increase in the tax rate may or may not increase the tax revenue, depending on where that actual tax rate is in the Laffer curve. For a given state, the government can reach the maximum fiscal surplus at the peak of the Laffer curve. At each point in time and for each state of the economy, the maximum primary balance will be derived from the difference between these maximum revenues and projected spending (<xref object="figure" type="sing" cont="no" format="xref" refid="IDd4d0ecde-9915-4e51-aa64-df810db527cc"/>). The resulting fiscal space will be computed as the sum of all these maximum primary surpluses, expressed in present value terms.</p>

In particular, the transmission mechanisms of an increase in public investment to the economy are very similar.

The budget deficit remains large and the cost of borrowing, although decreasing, is still very high. Indeed, the envisaged fiscal consolidation is welcome, but should be gradual to reduce the associated social costs. The commitment to inclusive growth, including through further improvements in education and well-targeted social transfers, is welcome. There is also room to reduce fiscal pressure on firms by making the tax system more efficient. Shifting government spending towards public investment and increasing competition by reducing barriers to trade, investment and entrepreneurship would raise productivity and inclusive growth.</emphasis>

In particular, the deep recession in Brazil has had a strong impact on exports, particularly in the automotive industry. As a result of the protracted recession that started in 2015, the unemployment rate is above 9% and a third of the population is below the poverty line.</p>

No further easing is projected, and rate increases are projected to begin towards the end of 2017 as spare capacity fades. Fiscal consolidation of around ½ percentage point of GDP is projected, as envisaged by the government. Despite the employment of macro-prudential measures to cool the housing market, the net gain from monetary easing has narrowed. Significant housing market concerns remain and there is growing discord between financial market developments and rest of the economy due to the low-interest-rate environment.</p>

Employment growth should result in a further decline in the unemployment rate. Household consumption growth is expected to remain solid, aided by further downward adjustment in the household saving ratio to the historical average. The pick-up in aggregate demand is not projected to generate significant inflationary pressure, due to remaining economic slack. </p>

About half of the increase in disposable income provided by the tax reform has been saved so far, and some spending may therefore still be in the pipeline. Fixed investment is back to its pre-crisis level, but remains lower as a fraction of GDP. Support has been provided by rising labour supply, reflecting immigration and more women and the elderly taking jobs. Manufacturing firms remain competitive, but the service sector has long suffered from weak productivity. The resulting rise in unit labour costs in services increases the cost of those services to manufacturers, weakening their international competitiveness and reducing Austria’s export performance.</p>

At the same time, historically low interest rates have created fiscal space. This fiscal room should be used for public investment that boosts growth potential and promotes social inclusion. Candidates are infrastructure investments in early childcare institutions and high-speed broadband internet coverage. Such investments would enhance equality of opportunities and thereby foster inclusiveness across genders and regions. Furthermore, a tax-and-benefit system that encourages a more balanced distribution of work, as well as more family-friendly workplaces and working-time models, would promote a more gender-equal society. </p>

A comprehensive spending review may help. Further savings could be expected from a bolder reform of the intergovernmental framework. In this regard, recent efforts to reduce misalignment between spending and financing responsibilities across levels of government should be stepped up. </p>

Economic activity could be stronger if export performance recovers from its recent slump or if the recent tax reform were to spur consumption more than projected. Second-round effects of the tax reform on employment and investment may also be stronger than anticipated. On the other hand, the projected rebound of investment could be hampered by weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area and emerging markets or by substantial increases in oil prices. Growth would also come in weaker than projected if the decline in export performance continues, if world trade growth does not pick up as projected or if the increase in the household saving rate were to persist. Finally, political uncertainties may affect investors and consumer confidence. </p>

Although the unemployment rate has edged downwards since the end of 2015, announcements of future layoffs in financial services and manufacturing have undermined consumer confidence. Temporary suspension of wage indexation is likely to have reduced unit labour costs for the third consecutive year in 2016, boosting exports. Inflation remains significantly higher than in other euro area countries largely due to an increase in indirect taxes, particularly on electricity, and higher education fees in Flanders. Price increases in certain market services are also elevated.</p>

Taxation could be further shifted towards less distortionary measures by extending road pricing and increasing taxation on company cars.

Mortgage loans constitute a relatively large share of the banking sector’s balance sheet. While the overall financial position of households appears relatively robust, some low-income households are vulnerable to a rapid decline in house prices. The macro-prudential authorities’ recent proposal for an additional capital buffer for risky mortgages should help mitigate this risk. On the other hand, tax reductions and labour market tightening could stimulate household consumption more than anticipated.</p>

However, the economy seems to be now turning around. Confidence indicators have recently started to recover after a long decline, even if their level is still low. Investment growth has turned positive, while signals from industrial production have been mixed. Political uncertainty has diminished as the new government has been confirmed in power by congress until the next scheduled elections in October 2018. </p>

          <p id="ID27edd053-bf89-4c8b-a328-2c1df99aedb2" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The fiscal deficit remains high at over 9% of GDP and the primary deficit of 3% of GDP is distant from the primary surpluses required to keep public debt on a firmly declining path. Part of this deterioration is cyclical and related to weak revenues in the face of the recession, but poorly targeted tax exemptions in the past, which have yet to be completely unwound, have also played a role. Against the background of considerable slack, the fiscal stance is estimated to be only mildly contractionary. This is part of a necessary adjustment process to strengthen fiscal sustainability and correct past excesses, and strikes an appropriate balance. </p>

These concerns are being adequately addressed with the implementation of a new expenditure rule, in line with recommendations in previous OECD <emphasis emph="italic">Economic Surveys</emphasis>. The new rule limits real increases in expenditures and reduces the rigidity of the budgeting process, except for pensions and benefits, which amount to almost half of central government spending. Implementing a separate pension reform will be crucial for turning the fiscal adjustment into a success, and could also lead to stronger declines in inequality and poverty by improving the targeting of social benefits. Scope for raising spending efficiency exists across many areas, and the new fiscal rule leaves sufficient room for attaining policy objectives. </p>

Reducing the compliance costs and distortions imposed by Brazil’s fragmented system of indirect taxes would provide an almost immediate cost reduction for firms, and could be achieved by consolidating indirect taxes into a single, broad-based value-added tax with full deductibility for inputs and a zero-rating for exports. In addition, reducing barriers to international trade would cut the costs of imported inputs and strengthen incentives to enhance productivity. Improvements in infrastructure could also reduce transport costs, particularly for exporters. Stronger trade integration would benefit low-income earners in particular, as an expansion of the export sector would have a larger impact on the demand for low-skilled labour. Further improvements in educational attainment would not only raise productivity, but also allow more low-income households to join Brazil’s growing middle class.</p>

The pace of the recovery will be limited by high corporate sector debt and significant spare capacity in some sectors. Nevertheless, the implementation of structural reforms will gain momentum relative to the past, but fall short of the ambitious agenda required. Slow earnings growth and a continuing contraction in private credit will limit consumption growth initially, although lower interest rates may eventually allow the recovery of consumption to accelerate. Against the background of low international trade growth and ongoing competitiveness challenges, the external sector will not be able to provide as much support as in past years. </p>

Although they have diminished, political risks remain with respect to the final implementation of the new fiscal rule.</p>

New measures increase the budget deficit by 0.6-0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 and a further 0.3% of GDP in 2018-19. The deficit increase reflects higher spending on physical infrastructure, social housing, education and innovation. The increase in spending on social housing will make growth more inclusive, as will the new Canada Child Benefit, which is means tested, and measures to foster Indigenous Peoples’ economic development and to make post-secondary education more affordable for students from low-income families.

The contraction of energy investment has slowed and should be nearly complete by the end of the year, at which time cumulative losses will have reached about 60% since 2014. Similarly, exports and other business investment are turning up, supported by gains in export competitiveness, a strengthening US economy and growing capacity constraints.</p>

Higher unemployment in the energy-producing provinces has reduced wage pressures. Consumer price inflation remains below the mid-point of the Bank of Canada’s 1-3% target range despite exchange rate depreciation, owing to a decline in energy prices.</p>

New measures, which are front-loaded, could boost growth by 0.5 percentage point in 2016 and 2017. The general government deficit is projected to rise by 0.9% of GDP over 2015-18, to 2.2% of GDP. This increase essentially reflects the 2016 federal budget measures to boost demand. They should be particularly effective in delivering short-term stimulus, as infrastructure and social housing, which are a focus of the measures, have higher multipliers than most other budget items. However, most of the CAD 60 billion (2¼ per cent of GDP) increase in infrastructure spending over the next 10 years announced in the budget is to occur in a second phase, beyond the projection period. The focus in that phase is on investments to increase productivity and reduce the energy system’s carbon footprint.</p>

With economic slack likely to be taken up by late 2018, it is assumed that monetary policy stimulus will be gradually withdrawn, starting in late 2017. Very low interest rates have encouraged household borrowing to purchase real estate, contributing to large increases in house prices, especially in Vancouver and Toronto, which together represent a third of the national market. Household debt is also high in relation to disposable income. To reduce offshore demand, British Columbia recently introduced a 15% stamp duty on houses purchased by non-residents, the Vancouver council imposed a special tax on vacant homes, and the federal government took steps to prevent non-residents from unduly claiming the capital gains tax exemption for principal residences. Macro-prudential measures have been strengthened recently but may need to be tightened further and targeted regionally. To discourage more risky lending, mortgage insurance, which is backed by the federal government, should cover only part of lenders’ losses in case of default, as proposed by the federal government.</p>

Fiscal stimulus and the waning drag from declining investment and employment in the resource sector should support the initial rise in growth, followed by a pick-up in non-energy exports. They should continue to benefit from the lower Canadian dollar and strengthening export market growth, which will be boosted by US fiscal stimulus, potentially increasing Canadian GDP growth by just over ¼ percentage point in 2018. Non-resource business investment should then rise with a lag as capacity constraints become binding. Growth in housing investment, on the other hand, should slow as further supply comes onto the market and the Vancouver and Toronto markets cool. Private consumption should continue to grow steadily, given moderate household income gains. The unemployment rate is projected to edge down to the structural rate (6½ per cent) by mid-2018. With excess capacity eliminated, well-anchored inflation expectations around the middle of the official inflation target band and gasoline prices and the exchange rate stable, the inflation rate could rise to around 2% by early 2018.</p>

This could result from an external shock that results in higher mortgage interest rates and/or unemployment, making it difficult for some financially stretched households to service their mortgage commitments. Such a correction would reduce residential investment and, through wealth effects, private consumption, and in an extreme case could threaten financial stability. There is also a risk that increased trade barriers in the major economies could stymie exports, reducing economic growth. The main upside risk is that the US expansion could be stronger than projected, lifting demand for Canadian exports. If global oil prices diverge from their assumed level, Canadian growth would also be correspondingly affected. </p>

Capacity cuts in the coal and steel sectors, together with disruptions in the distribution chain due to floods, have resulted in regional coal shortages and price hikes. The private-sector share in investment has shrunk partly because many services, which are a growing part of the economy, are not open for private investment. Real estate investment is bottoming out, although trends in upper and lower-tier cities are increasingly diverging, with sharply rising demand and prices in the former, prompting new home-purchase restrictions. In lower-tier cities, working off excess capacity may take several more years.</p>

Liquidity provision to mitigate the effect of capital outflows tends to be channelled to overheated sectors. With falling returns and more enterprise defaults, banks are shifting new lending from the productive sector to the property and securities markets. Enterprise leverage, especially in the state-owned sector, is high. Debt-equity swaps may provide temporary relief but risk delaying necessary adjustment, including the exit of unviable firms. Loans with past-due payment have soared, foreshadowing a surge in bad debt. Recent defaults are expected to instil greater market discipline and better credit risk pricing, but occasional bailouts strengthen the perception that public sector entities enjoy implicit guarantees.</p>

Policy banks have issued large amounts of debt, exceeding the original target, to support major infrastructure projects. The rapid expansion of public investment may lead to further misallocation of capital. Furthermore, local government investment vehicles will be key players in implementing these projects. As they are still perceived to carry implicit guarantees, their re-leveraging may lead to another round of accumulation of implicit government debt and bailouts. Although gross public debt is still around 40% of GDP, large future spending obligations loom in the areas of social security, health and old-age care. </p>

However, investment is increasingly financed by public funds. Opening up additional sectors to private investment will provide new opportunities for private capital. Current growth rates of disposable income will support consumption growth, but without structural reforms to reduce precautionary savings such as the provision of a better social safety net and higher-quality public services, rebalancing will advance only slowly. The slow pace of reform of state‑owned enterprises and high leverage will continue to take up resources, preventing reallocation for more efficient use.</p>

Excessive leverage and mounting debt in the corporate sector compound financial stability problems. Rapid adjustment in the real estate and industrial sectors would drag down growth temporarily, but is necessary to strengthen resilience. Supply-side policies, including deleveraging and working off excess capacity, are crucial to avoid a sharp slowdown down the road. Greater-than-expected stimulus, in contrast, would result in stronger growth in the short term but larger imbalances later. On the upside, a stronger-than-foreseen global rebound would support Chinese exports and growth.</p>

In the medium term, approving the tax reform currently in Congress is required to increase tax revenue, meet social and economic spending needs and reduce oil-related fiscal vulnerabilities.</p>

In the medium term, key reforms should be aimed at further reducing informality, raising tax revenue, promoting financial inclusion and sustaining increased public investment. Strengthening the enforcement of the labour laws, reducing non-wage labour costs and easing procedures to register companies would lower informality further and extend coverage of social benefits. Expanding the use and access to active labour market programmes and early childhood education, alongside better elderly and disability care, would also bring more women into the labour market and make growth more inclusive.</p>

However, fiscal space is limited given the still rising debt-to-GDP ratio and high interest payments, which absorb 20% of total revenue. There has been some progress on the tax reform, with 6 out of 13 projects of the reform package approved. However, two important bills to replace the sales tax with a full-fledged VAT system and a reform of the income tax are still under discussion in the legislative assembly. </p>

The VAT and the income tax reform would cut the deficit by about 2% of GDP, which would help stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio. The reforms are well thought out as they will broaden tax bases and the introduction of a VAT is a growth-friendly way to raise revenues. Additional fiscal or expenditure control measures of 1% of GDP will be needed to put debt on a firm downward path. These should focus on reforming the public employment system to prevent excessive automatic salary increases and raise public sector efficiency. </p>

Furthermore, as Costa Rica is a small open economy, external developments are critical, such as higher international energy prices and extreme bouts of market volatility. Uncertainty in the international markets, and currency depreciation could create problems for the stability of the banking system given its high dollarisation.</p>

Monetary policy is very accommodative, with the policy rate near zero and the exchange rate floor preventing appreciation against the euro. To mitigate financial stability risks, the central bank lowered the recommended maximum loan-to-value ratio on housing loans from October 2016 and counter-cyclical capital buffers will be required from January 2017. The central bank should exit the floor as deflationary risks recede, as planned. It could then gradually lift the policy rate, as assumed in the projections. The strong fiscal position provides space to offset the demand effects of exchange rate appreciation, if needed. </p>

Slower growth in world trade would lower exports through value chains. Conversely, exports could outperform if productivity gains offset rising costs. The risks from Brexit are two-sided: businesses may delay investment but any arrangement preserving European integration would particularly benefit Czech exporters. Domestic risks are mostly to the upside. Accelerating consumer credit or wages could fuel stronger consumption growth than projected.

Current accommodative financial conditions continue to feed into rising house prices, in particular in Copenhagen.

Exports are being restrained by globally lower volumes of shipping and weak external developments.</p>

This is fuelling price increases in the Copenhagen housing market, requiring continued vigilance. In that context, the reform of property taxation announced for the early 2020s will bring back an important counter-cyclical feature, but it could be too late to prevent another housing bubble. The authorities should therefore stand ready to impose stricter macro-prudential measures, for instance a limit on debt service to income ratios. Measures to develop the rental market could also ease house price increases. </p>

However, if wages become disconnected from productivity improvements the competitiveness of Danish exports could be undermined. Proposed reforms to improve work incentives are welcome as labour shortages and wage pressures are likely to intensify. In particular, more can be done to bring some marginalised groups to the labour market, which would both raise growth and make it more inclusive. </p>

Given the moderate public debt level, existing fiscal space and the benefits of such reforms, this policy is welcome. The package, still under discussion, includes higher public investment during 2018-2025, a decrease in the corporate tax burden and an overhaul of public utilities. The package would also improve medium-term fiscal sustainability by increasing the retirement age, and raising incentives for private pension savings and work. </p>

A new tax refund for low-income earners, a higher family benefit and income tax allowance, and another significant increase in the minimum wage will support household purchasing power. Employer social security contributions will edge down from 33 per cent to 32.5 per cent and so only modestly mitigate the rise in labour costs. </p>

In particular, public spending can help to tackle upcoming supply-side constraints. Intensifying wage pressures and labour shortages will erode Estonia’s competitiveness and its attractiveness for foreign investors. The tax wedge, which remains high by international standards, should be cut by further reducing social security contributions on low wage earners. The increase in the retirement age and the disability reform are expected to increase labour supply but active labour market policies should be stepped up to improve the employability of jobseekers. Also, more could be done to alleviate skill mismatch and boost labour productivity, notably by improving the quality of vocational education and removing infrastructure bottlenecks. </p>

It is increasingly clear that fiscal policy will have to play a larger role if Europe is to escape its low-growth trap. </p>

Furthermore, the countries where fiscal expansion is projected to be strongest are not always the ones where fiscal space is the largest, and some expansionary measures already planned will not make the composition of public finances more growth and equity-friendly. Fiscal stimulus should be increased, especially in countries with the most room for manoeuvre. Fiscal policy can also be made more supportive of growth and inclusiveness by reprioritising spending and taxation. Examples include giving higher priority to spending on education and childcare, with accompanying institutional and efficiency improvements, and decreasing labour taxation, especially for low earners. Another example is to focus spending on well-chosen and executed soft and hard infrastructure investments, such as Trans-European railways and energy network projects, which raise aggregate demand and, once in place, aggregate supply. Beyond fiscal policy, product market structural reforms to complete the Single Market in services and network sectors should also receive high priority. </p>

Domestic demand will be subdued, reflecting overburdened monetary policy, insufficient fiscal support and several structural bottlenecks. Despite modest export growth, the large current account surplus will persist. The projected decline in unemployment will still leave substantial labour market slack in many countries, and inflation, though gradually increasing, will consequently remain well below 2%.</p>

Financial turbulence abroad would decrease demand for euro area exports and investment. Confidence in the euro area could weaken due to idiosyncratic political or banking sector risks in vulnerable countries. A possible decision by the European Central Bank to taper unconventional policies would reduce risks of financial distortions but could rekindle tensions in sovereign debt markets, with knock-on effects in other asset markets. On the other hand, stronger fiscal and structural policy action than is now envisaged by policymakers would deliver higher growth than projected. </p>

Very low wage increases, agreed by social partners to restore price competitiveness, are holding back private consumption. However, household real disposable income is rising due to low inflation. Coupled with low interest rates, this supports a rebound in investment, especially in construction. Investment in machinery and equipment, notably in large-scale forestry and energy projects, is also strong. The unemployment rate is falling thanks to job creation in services and construction, while population ageing is shrinking the labour force. The fiscal deficit remains close to 3% of GDP, as spending cuts and higher revenue are offset by increasing age-related costs. </p>

The ongoing series of tax cuts will continue to reduce revenues, and the 2017 draft budget includes additional spending on employment, education and security. Yet, spending restraint in other areas, stronger growth and lower debt service, which is projected to fall by a full percentage point of GDP from 2012 levels by the end of the projection period, will help cut the deficit gradually to 2.9% of GDP in 2018.</p>

To help France escape from its low-growth trap and ensure durable reductions in unemployment, planned tax cuts should be pulled forward. However, reducing the tax burden will require controlling spending through reforms that are sustainable in the long term. After years of across-the-board expenditure restraint and a partial public-sector wage freeze, the authorities need to focus more on inefficiencies and identify non-priority areas for cuts. </p>

Such measures would make room for better supporting children and young adults, who are too often harmed by high unemployment and poverty. Building on recent sub-central government streamlining, further reforms are needed to reduce the large number of municipalities and eliminate overlaps in competencies across different levels of government. Education spending is broadly appropriate but needs to be better targeted at weak students. The quality of infrastructure is high overall, but the recent consolidation focussed too much on public investment cuts, and this needs to be reversed, while better targeting poor neighbourhoods.</p>

The extension of the accelerated depreciation allowance into 2017 and additional reductions in social contributions and business taxes will contribute to stronger business investment. The gradual recovery in residential investment is projected to continue, and public investment should grow moderately. The prospect of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union is projected to hold back France’s exports. The current account deficit will stay largely stable at around 1% of GDP. Owing to persistent substantial slack, core consumer price inflation is not expected to accelerate.</p>
          <p id="IDdff276ba-5366-450b-b5e4-5805b567b868" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"> The 2017 presidential elections create considerable uncertainty, as candidates’ economic programmes differ widely. Adverse developments in emerging markets, China in particular, would also have negative repercussions. If the nature of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union were to be clarified faster than expected and turned out to involve a more favourable trade regime with EU countries, such as continued adherence to the single market, French exports and investment could be stronger than under the baseline assumptions. Moreover, the medium-term effects of lower taxes and social charges on business sentiment could be larger than expected, leading to stronger investment, employment and consumption. Also, households have not yet spent all their energy-related savings but could do so in the future.</p>

Credit growth remained low, as regulation of mortgage lending tightened. House prices have broadly risen in line with rental prices and incomes. </p>

Higher spending on key education services and tax reform would boost inclusive and green growth. Training for immigrants and the supply of childcare and full-day primary schools need to expand further. More resources should be provided to schools with a relatively high share of pupils with disadvantaged socio-economic background.

Lower barriers for setting up a business, for example in construction-related crafts, would boost economic opportunities for immigrants, who are particularly likely to seek self-employment and employment in the construction sector. Lowering such barriers could help ease supply bottlenecks in the construction sector. Many refugees have poor German language skills and lack formal qualifications, and will not find jobs quickly. The government has expanded training opportunities and facilitated access to the education system. It has improved refugees’ incentives to engage in training, for example by lowering legal barriers for refugees to take up jobs before their asylum request is processed.</p>

Strong domestic demand will push up consumer prices somewhat, as wages grow more strongly than productivity. The current account surplus will fall somewhat. Unemployment is expected to remain historically low. Subdued world trade and investment in key trading partners will keep export growth at a modest level and price competitiveness may weaken somewhat. Brexit-related weakness in the United Kingdom, Germany’s third largest trading partner, will also damp exports. Notwithstanding fiscal easing, strong tax revenue growth and declining debt servicing costs are expected to raise the government surplus.</p>
          <p id="ID177e3c7c-4004-489f-8f56-bee85287afd5" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union has increased uncertainty about trade and investment prospects. A sharp slowdown of activity in emerging market economies and protracted weak demand in the euro area would weaken exports and investment. In the event of sharp losses among systemically important banks, financial market confidence could suffer substantially. On the other hand, some businesses have indicated they are considering shifting investment from the United Kingdom to Germany. Steps to implement reforms to complete the Single Market in the European Union and establish a more comprehensive banking union in the euro area could boost exports and the attractiveness of Germany as a location to invest. </p>

However, travel receipts declined in the first half of 2016 and the contribution of tourism to GDP growth is expected to decrease further due to the impact of Brexit and the refugee crisis. Financing conditions are still weak with the high level of non-performing loans limiting credit, despite the gradual but steady easing of the capital controls. Notwithstanding weak activity, employment has continued to increase, especially in manufacturing, but unemployment is still very high, resulting in a great deal of poverty.</p>

The government has legislated fiscal measures to reach the primary surplus target of 1.75% of GDP for 2017 and 3.5% for 2018. These measures include broadening of the tax base as well as spending cuts at a time when social needs are important.  The government is undertaking a pilot review of some spending categories and plans to extend the review to the entire public administration to identify inefficiencies. The aim will be to redirect resources towards social protection measures to combat the exclusion and poverty that arose in the wake of the crisis that began in 2009. Notwithstanding these welcome initiatives, some form of debt relief will be needed to raise growth and incomes. </p>

Fully implementing social policies, such as the guaranteed minimum income, a targeted school meal and housing assistance programmes, is therefore needed. The conclusion of the pension system reform will improve fairness, as pensioners are better off than the younger generation, and free up resources for greater support for the poor and the unemployed. The modernisation of the public employment service would benefit the high number of unemployed, especially among youth and the long‑term unemployed. </p>

Further reducing administrative burdens and opening up of professions would enhance productivity and investment, particularly for SMEs. Continuing easing of regulations in energy, communications and transports would raise competitiveness and enhance exports. The acceleration of privatisations would raise competitiveness and efficiency. Further broadening the tax base and ensuring that the new independent public revenue agency improves tax compliance and collection would increase revenues and help fighting tax evasion. That revenue could be used to support social policies and to make growth more inclusive.</p>

Exporters have been sustained so far only because firms have cut prices, but this cannot continue indefinitely. Private consumption, on the other hand, sustained its brisk pace on the back of rising real incomes.</p>

Together with slower growth of the labour force, this has reduced the unemployment rate by almost 2 percentage points over the past year, to around 5%. Accordingly, wage compensation in the private sector has accelerated, reaching more than 5%. Headline inflation hovered around zero until late 2016, when the impact of previous declines in energy prices came to an end and higher indirect taxes pushed it to 1%. Excluding the effects of food and energy prices, core inflation has also dropped to about 1½ per cent.</p>

However, considerable inflationary pressure has built up, as reflected in very large wage increases. The central bank needs to keep a tight stance if it is to achieve low and stable inflation. The uncertainties surrounding the final steps in liberalisation of the capital account pose further monetary and financial policy challenges for the central bank. The projections assume that it will raise short-term interest rates. Given the projected high interest rate differential with the rest of the world, macro-prudential tools need to be used to reign in potential unstable short-term debt capital inflows as controls are relaxed.</p>

Moderation in investment, end of the positive terms-of-trade shock and inflation pressures will gradually erode demand, and growth will slow in 2018 to more sustainable levels. The unemployment rate will stabilise at a low level.</p>

Possible future wage increases can fuel this further. Liberalisation of the capital account raises uncertainty about capital flows, while at the same time the relatively high interest rates could cause large capital inflows and strong appreciation of the Krona, hurting the economy. Slower growth in the global economy, and in particular more negative effects of Brexit than assumed, could have negative consequences for exports, notably tourism.</p>

Private consumption in urban areas is buoyed by an increase in public wages and pensions by over 20% in 2016 and 2017. The return to normal weather conditions, after two years of a poor monsoon, is raising agricultural production and consumption in rural areas. Exports bounced back early in 2016 and export orders are growing. However, private investment has remained weak, dragged down by low capacity utilisation and the weak financial position of some corporations. Job creation in the organised sector has also remained subdued.</p>

The increase in public wages and pensions, combined with the need to recapitalise public banks, will leave little room in this and next year’s budgets for higher public investment. In the longer term, the government should aim to raise public spending on education, health, water, energy and transport infrastructure to improve access for all to core basic services and to reduce bottlenecks to investment. Higher revenue from property and the personal income tax could finance additional spending.</p>

Going forward, there is little room for significant further cuts since the rise in public sector wages, still high inflation expectations and firmer commodity prices will make reaching the 4% mid-range inflation target challenging. However, even in the absence of more cuts, some monetary impulse is still to come as monetary policy transmission has been slow and incomplete so far.</p>

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) should replace a myriad of consumption and sales taxes. By reducing tax cascading, the GST will boost competitiveness, investment and economic activity in the medium term. The government aims to implement the GST from April 2017, which is ambitious given the number of key parameters still to be agreed upon, the still complex legislative process involved and the required IT infrastructure to be developed. However, the projections assume that this objective will be met.</p>
          <p id="ID34afec4d-d747-4b17-856e-b3a99fffcadf" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The new Bankruptcy Code should facilitate time-bound closure of businesses and the reallocation of resources to more productive firms and prevent the build-up of non-performing loans. Implementing the Code and reducing delays will require improving judicial institutions. Recent cuts in administrative requirements for hiring are most welcome. They should be accompanied by efforts to modernise labour laws, including at the state level, to boost quality job creation. Recent efforts to raise power generation capacity, including the focus on renewable energy, are promising. Adjusting utility prices to ensure they cover costs would make supply more responsive to demand conditions. </p>

The implementation of the GST from April 2017 should lower the price of capital goods and lift investment although it may have short-term adverse effects on prices and demand for services which will likely be subject to a higher rate of tax. The revival of (import-intensive) corporate investment and lower remittance flows will weigh on the current account deficit. Robust FDI inflows should, however, mitigate India’s external vulnerability.</p>
          <p id="ID8b3f576c-abfd-4f0f-af9f-8b3e0f6c4d50" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Further structural reform is a clear upside risk for growth. Some states have taken the lead in reforming land and labour market regulations but it is still unclear whether others will follow suit. There are also downside risks to the projections. Rolling out the GST later than projected may delay the investment recovery. Slower efforts to clean up banks’ balance sheets and to recapitalise public banks would raise uncertainties and hurt investment. An increase in commodity prices would raise inflation, dampen private consumption and weigh on both the current account and fiscal deficits. Weak demand in major trading partners will affect exporting sectors. Geopolitical risks could escalate, affecting business sentiment and creating pressures on public (military) spending. </p>

Investment was hit by weak commodity prices and regulatory uncertainty in the mining sector, but has now started to recover on the back of stabilised commodity prices and accelerated government spending on infrastructure. Exports are also beginning to recover after sharp declines due to lower external demand for commodities and a ban on exporting unprocessed ores.</p>

Slower growth and low commodity prices have also cut into revenue. In light of these revenue shortfalls, the government has twice revised the 2016 budget, including expenditure cuts totalling over 7% of expenditure. A tax amnesty now underway is meant to help plug the hole in the budget. Public debt is low, at 27.3% of GDP in 2015, well below the 60% constitutional limit. </p>

This will require raising taxes by broadening the base and strengthening tax administration. In addition to improving the country’s infrastructure, more needs to be done to tackle poverty and inequality – especially in the remote regions. While impressive progress has been made in improving standards of living, the social security system needs to be further expanded and access to high quality health and education improved. Addressing the high rate of labour market and business informality would facilitate access to government services and broaden the tax base.</p>

Firstly, if revenues continue to weaken, the government could hit the maximum deficit threshold and be forced to pull back on general expenditure, including infrastructure spending. If the switch from public to private participation in infrastructure investment does not happen, activity will weaken. Secondly, if trading partner demand falls dramatically and the external balance worsens, the exchange rate may come under renewed pressure, and the monetary authorities would have to be more cautious. An increase in worldwide trade protectionism would also threaten growth in Indonesia. On the upside, commodity prices may rebound more strongly, and this would boost growth and reduce the fiscal deficit.</p>

The unemployment rate has declined, while labour force participation remains somewhat subdued. Wage growth is strong, but inflationary pressures are contained due to the global low inflation environment. Strong labour earnings growth has supported household consumption. Overall investment was boosted thanks to intangibles investment by MNEs, while business investment in the domestic sector has risen steadily albeit at a moderate pace.</p>

Improved fiscal trends allow some unwinding of these measures, including a tax cut in 2017 for low-paid households, which should support their incomes and encourage people to join the labour market. Both effects will increase the inclusiveness of growth. The six-year plan on infrastructure for 2016-21 will raise public investment as a ratio of GDP by 0.5 percentage point over the next six years, reversing the past declines. This should enhance growth. If more fiscal room becomes available, this plan should be scaled up.</p>

The 2017 budget provides a range of incentives to boost investment and innovation and lowers the corporate income tax rate from 27.5 to 24%. It also extends for two years social security contribution exemptions for new permanent contracts, but limits them to newly-hired students who have completed internships at the firm. It also raises spending on low pensions and, to a much lesser extent, family benefits and the income-support scheme for the poor. The government plans to negotiate with the European Union a fiscal leeway amounting to about 0.4% of GDP on the ground of exceptional economic circumstances linked to the recent earthquake, the refugee crisis and infrastructure investment. Lower interest payments and the mild economic expansion will keep the headline budget deficit at 2.4% of GDP in 2017 and 2018. This fiscal stance is broadly appropriate provided that the available fiscal space is used to finance policies leading to faster and more sustainable growth.</p>

Since 2012 the effective interest rate on the public debt has declined by around a third, to about 3%, cutting interest payments by about 20%. The authorities should use this room to restore public investment, which has dropped in nominal terms by more than 30% since the start of the crisis, to 2.2% of GDP, the lowest level in more than 25 years. Raising public investment will accelerate growth and help reduce the debt ratio. Priorities could include a multi-year programme to make buildings earthquake proof and promoting decarbonisation of the economy in line with the COP21 goal. In addition, education spending and family benefits, which are low for an OECD country, should be raised to increase productivity and alleviate poverty. </p>

The constitutional reform that will be subject to a referendum in December would be a step forward as it would streamline the legislative process and clarify the division of responsibilities between the central and local governments that has hindered public and private investment. More can be done to make the taxation system fairer and more effective, primarily by permanently cutting social security contributions on lower income and shifting taxation towards consumption and immovable property. Fighting high poverty among families with children through a targeted national programme should be a priority. Strengthening the provision of good quality care for children and the elderly would help permanently raise labour market participation among women.</p>

Uncertainties concerning the banking sector and the effect of Brexit will moderate private consumption growth in 2017. In 2018, the expiration of social security contribution exemptions will mitigate employment growth. The moderate economic expansion and credit supply constraints linked to bad loans will curb private investment. Low growth in the euro area and other main trading partners will keep restraining sales abroad.</p>
          <p id="IDed81aaf4-feba-4a44-9683-0bb3e2febc03" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The resolution of uncertainties surrounding the banking sector and Brexit could help restore consumer confidence, leading to faster private consumption growth than expected. Faster progress on reducing bad loans would mitigate credit supply constraints. The planned increase in public investment could also be faster and more effective than anticipated, although implementation delays would have the opposite effect. Exports may benefit more than envisaged from expansionary policies in large non-EU economies. On the other hand, renewed financial market turmoil in the euro area or an aggravation of banks' balance sheet problems could drive risk spreads higher, raise debt financing costs and require a fiscal retrenchment. The refugee crisis could again intensify, straining government finances and capacity to deal with a larger influx of immigrants. Higher oil and energy prices would diminish household purchasing power, lowering private consumption. A new wave of trade protectionism would hinder exports to non-EU countries.</p>

Investment in areas such as education and training is needed to boost Japan's growth potential. Limiting the negative impact of higher taxes on growth requires relying primarily on the consumption tax for increased revenue, accompanied by an earned income tax credit to promote employment and social cohesion.</emphasis>

Growth was led by consumer spending, supported by wage growth, which was nonetheless surprisingly muted given the tightest labour market conditions in 25 years. Consumer purchasing power was also boosted by the fall in headline inflation back into negative territory, in part due to declining oil prices. Even excluding energy and food prices, inflation is close to zero. After declining in the first half of 2016, exports rebounded sharply in the third quarter of 2016.</p>

Such a plan should include detailed and concrete measures to boost revenues through gradual increases in the consumption tax, broadening the personal and corporate income tax bases and raising environmental taxes. The plan should also include reforms to contain the growth of social spending. In healthcare, savings could be achieved by shortening hospital stays and increasing elderly co-payments for health and long-term care spending. As for public pensions, it is important to raise the pension eligibility age and to fully apply macroeconomic indexation to pension benefits. </p>

In September 2016, with inflation negative, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced a new policy framework based on <shortcitation>yield curve control</shortcitation> to keep the yield on 10-year government bonds near its current level of around zero. The new framework enhances flexibility in the amount of bond purchases. The short-term interest rate is to remain at -0.1% for a portion (about 4%) of bank deposits at the central bank.

          <p id="ID2aaf0fe1-bfb0-478d-bb9d-4aac07609925" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Annual output growth is projected to remain between ¾ per cent and 1% over 2016-18. Although real wage gains are expected to ease as the increase in inflation outstrips wage growth, a fall in the saving rate to its pre-2013 level, supported by the improvement in consumer confidence, is projected to sustain private consumption. Export growth is expected to pick up with the rebound in international trade and this will support investment in the business sector, where profitability and cash holdings are historically high. As fiscal stimulus and reconstruction fade, the downward trend in public investment will resume, although it will be partly offset by construction related to the 2020 Olympics. Inflation is projected to rise to 1¼ per cent by the end of 2018, while the current account surplus remains close to 4% of GDP.</p>
          <p id="IDecc20ae1-355e-428d-aa7d-c67d06471eb4" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Sustained output growth requires a virtuous circle of rising prices, wages and corporate earnings. The major uncertainty is wage growth, which has remained sluggish despite high corporate profitability and labour shortages. If firms raise wages more rapidly than projected to reduce labour shortages, private consumption and output growth would be stronger. The major downside risk is that the improvement in consumer confidence will not be sustained, leaving the household saving rate high. A second risk is Japan’s unprecedentedly high level of public debt. Unless it implements a more detailed and concrete strategy to stabilise the debt ratio, Japan could face a loss of confidence in its fiscal sustainability, which in turn could destabilise the financial sector and the real economy, with large spillovers to the world economy. External risks are largely on the downside, given uncertainty about China, which accounts for a quarter of Japanese exports.</p>

The accompanying rise in mortgage lending has pushed household debt above 170% of disposable income. Although export growth slowed to 1% in the first three quarters of 2016, the current account surplus reached around 7½ per cent of GDP and inflation remained below 1%.</p>

As the prospect of further monetary expansion may be increasingly constrained, fiscal policy should be used more actively as a way of ensuring adequate aggregate demand. The fiscal position is strong and increased spending on priority areas, including investment to boost productivity and social spending, would be welcome. However, in the absence of additional fiscal stimulus, spending growth in 2017-18 is set to slow. An improved fiscal framework is a priority to allow greater flexibility to help Korea break out of its low-growth trap while keeping public debt low over the long term. </p>

Credit growth remains low, as banks have only eased their lending standards marginally despite the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy stance.

Structural unemployment is high and the informal sector is large. The government introduced in 2016 individualised support for the long-term unemployed that includes a health assessment, consultation and a motivation programme. Such measures are welcome, given that high unemployment is strongly related to poverty. The government is also gradually increasing the basic labour income tax allowance for earnings around the minimum wage to encourage formal employment of low-income workers. In order to address skill shortages, the government has been engaging in extensive reforms of vocational and tertiary education. However, apprenticeship positions and lifelong learning opportunities that enable upskilling are still limited. Barriers to entrepreneurship, such as the complex permits and licences system and the low recovery of loans in insolvency procedures, continue to hamper the efficient allocation of credit and productivity growth.</p>

The export sector has recovered from the recession in Russia and counter-sanctions in 2015. In contrast, investment fell in the first half of 2016 on the back of lower EU disbursements of structural funds. Strong labour demand in the private sector, combined with a decline in the labour force, has driven the unemployment rate lower and raised wage pressures.</p>

Private consumption will be supported by rising wages as well as an ageing-related decline in the saving rate. Nevertheless, a falling population will constrain further increases in aggregate consumption. Exports are projected to recover in line with activity in major export markets. The recovery in trade, as well as an increase in EU funding disbursements, should contribute to stronger investment growth. Pressures on resources will gradually intensify over the projection period, pushing inflation higher.</p>

Although affordable, the tax cuts could be partly compensated by increasing currently low taxation on housing. The possibility of individual taxation of family income could lead to lower marginal tax rates for second earners, mostly women, hence improving their incentive to work full-time and make better use of their skills. Higher tax credits for childcare and the recent extension of the childcare voucher scheme to cross-border workers will reduce barriers to work by making it easier to manage a job and a family. Active labour market policies offering individualised support and focusing on training, rather than on temporary job creation, are crucial to reduce long-term unemployment and boost inclusive growth.</p>
          <p id="IDad7c09f8-8aab-4c00-aeec-9505f184188a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n"> However, the incentives introduced by the reforms need to be coupled by additional changes in structural policies. Including childcare providers outside Luxembourg in the childcare voucher scheme could prevent structural imbalances between demand and supply. Rising house prices in Luxembourg may reflect supply bottlenecks that should be addressed by reformed zoning regulations, simplifying procedures for granting building permits and improved provision of social housing. </p>

The external environment is difficult, with the global economy remaining in a low-growth trap and poor expectations depressing trade, investment, and wages. Headwinds specific to Mexico include collapsing oil prices, which decreased government receipts, cutbacks in energy sector investments, and the sharply depreciating Mexican peso following market expectations of US Federal Reserve tightening, and policy uncertainty in the United States. Domestic demand remains the main driver of growth thanks to the strong expansion of credit combined with gains in real wages, employment and foreign remittances. Unemployment remains low. The large depreciation of the peso has further increased the competitiveness of Mexican non-oil exports, with associated inflationary pressures being offset by reform-driven price reductions of several services.</p>

The loss of budget revenue following the collapse of global oil prices posed a challenge and an opportunity for Mexico, which it successfully met by implementing a reform to raise taxes by 3% of GDP since 2014, thereby significantly reducing fiscal dependence on oil. The central bank has raised its target interest rate by 225 basis points to 5.25% since end-2015 with the objective of countering inflationary pressures resulting from the significant depreciation of the peso and keeping inflation expectations anchored close to the 3% target.</p>

Trade openness, foreign direct investment, integration into global value chains and incentives to introduce innovative technologies have boosted selected activities, such as auto production. However, many other activities lag behind and more needs to be done to motivate people to participate in the formal labour market, while ensuring satisfactory work-life balance, and equipping workers with the necessary skills to be productive. Further reforms are needed to address the misallocation of productive resources, due to overly stringent local regulations, weak legal institutions, high rates of corruption and insufficient financial inclusion. Reforms should also aim at eradicating extreme poverty, reducing income inequality and informality, raising female participation, and encouraging more responsible business practices.</p>

Supporting investment in research and development would also enhance long-term growth, while stronger investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency is needed to meet environmental targets. Priority spending could be financed, and the tax system made more effective, by accelerating the reduction in mortgage interest tax relief and phasing out lower VAT rates. </p>

The Netherlands is more exposed to Brexit than other European countries due to its strong trade and financial links with the United Kingdom and its position as a commercial hub. Still, it has ample policy space to cushion the impact of a shock. On the upside, private consumption could be stronger than projected if households fully translate their rapid gains in real income into higher spending.</p>

House prices and household debt have risen to very high levels, raising economic and financial stability risks. The Reserve Bank has attempted to limit financial stability risks by tightening loan-to-value restrictions. Additional macro-prudential measures, such as debt-to-income restrictions, may be required if rapid price increases persist. In addition to initiatives underway to address restrictive land-use rules, notably the Auckland Unitary Plan, more social housing and/or higher targeted housing subsidies are needed to attenuate the effects of high housing costs on low-income households.</p>

The government has substantial fiscal space: net general government debt is currently 5% of GDP and projected to fall further, and the deficit is near zero. The fiscal policy stance is neutral to mildly contractionary in 2016-17, which is appropriate to forestall overheating. Although subject to future changes in spending in response to the November 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, the fiscal stance is set to become more contractionary as government investment declines through 2017. This is despite considerable scope to improve infrastructure. Government planning should begin now to establish a pipeline of good quality projects, including to promote productivity-enhancing urban densification and to service the rapidly expanding housing stock. As such investment would occur when the Canterbury rebuild is winding down, such spending would support growth and the construction industry would be better placed to meet this demand than at present. Spending should also be increased on measures to reduce poverty rates amongst welfare beneficiaries with children, Maori and Pasifika. Such spending should be on measures to enhance education and health outcomes, and to activate welfare beneficiaries. </p>

Export growth is expected to slow but will continue to be driven by strong tourism demand from Asia and increases in dairy exports. Recent dairy price increases have raised pay-outs above the breakeven rate for the median dairy farm and are expected to drive a recovery in herd sizes following declines in 2015.</p>

The economic effects of the Kaikoura earthquake are still unclear, but are likely to include some short-term curtailment of activity coupled with medium-term fiscal stimulus from reconstruction work. External risks centre on China, directly through demand for agricultural exports and indirectly through Chinese demand for exports from New Zealand’s key trading partners. There are upside risks if dairy price increases continue or if net immigration does not decline to the assumed extent. </p>

The impact of the exchange rate depreciation on domestic prices was stronger than expected, but inflation expectations appear well anchored. Sustained low interest rates have fuelled a long housing boom, and a correction could significantly hurt economic growth. Further tightening of mortgage-lending rules may help, but the reliance on very low interest rates to support growth should be reconsidered. </p>
          <p id="ID32c08f8e-4138-4b4f-aa79-7fb512e1dc6b" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">The 2017 budget provides a fiscal stimulus of 0.4 percentage point of mainland GDP. Budget measures include further cuts in the corporate tax rate along with increased spending on infrastructure, regional support and the integration of refugees. Norway has considerable fiscal space due to its oil fund (Government Pension Fund Global). Additional fiscal stimulus, rather than a further easing of monetary policy, should be used to support activity as long as slack remains in the economy. The prospect of lower returns from the oil fund may require a tighter stance in the medium term in order to adhere to the Norwegian fiscal framework. </p>
          <p id="ID9cd3d92f-cb31-4df6-94ec-ea2e42f28987" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">A successful structural adjustment towards broader-based growth hinges on policies that boost productivity and combat exclusion. Recent initiatives are welcome, including further cuts in the corporate tax rate and simplification of reporting requirements and regulations for businesses. The government’s focus on improving the quality of education outcomes is also appropriate. Proposals for stricter requirements for teacher qualifications go in the right direction. Completion rates of secondary and tertiary education need to increase further. Tertiary-education reform should address the incentives that drive student decisions on the choice of courses and the pace of study. Further reforms to sickness and disability support should encourage participation in the labour force and potentially boost inclusiveness and well-being. </p>

Better global prospects and improved competitiveness will help non-oil exports and non-oil investment. The decline in petroleum investment is expected to slow as new projects commence, reducing the drag on activity. The unemployment rate will peak in 2016 at around 4¾ per cent of the labour force. Inflation will edge down, as the impact of the exchange rate depreciation abates and economic slack continues.</p>

Developments in Europe, through export demand, will also influence the pace of the recovery.

Domestically, the high level of household debt remains a source of real-side and financial risk. However, improvements in international competitiveness could boost growth more than projected.</p>

The steady decline in the unemployment rate, a minimum wage hike and higher social levies on some atypical labour contracts are set to increase wage growth further and shrink earnings inequality. Stabilising energy prices, rising demand pressure and the pass-through of new taxes to consumers will underpin a return to inflation closer to the target. The central bank should gradually increase its policy rate towards the end of 2017 as underlying price pressures are set to strengthen.</p>

Rising social spending, a rebound in public investment, and a planned reduction in the statutory retirement age could push the deficit over the Maastricht ceiling of 3% of GDP in 2018, despite additional taxes on banks and retailers. Planned tax cuts for low-income households could also increase the deficit further. Although the overall fiscal path appears broadly appropriate, ongoing reforms are not conducive to long-term growth and female labour force participation. By contrast, bringing forward and carefully selecting public infrastructure projects, and expanding childcare facilities would take full advantage of currently low financing costs. </p>

This would require stable energy and climate change policies and stronger local administrative capacity to raise investment efficiency. At the same time, more lifelong training opportunities and a larger rental housing market would help reduce skill mismatches and enhance worker mobility, strengthening productivity and inclusiveness. Over the longer term, enhancing employment incentives for women and older workers, as well as increasing green taxes, would raise revenues and help finance rising health, pension and infrastructure needs, and increase growth and well-being.</p>

A large stock of non-performing legacy loans is crowding out investment funding from banks.

Consequently, fiscal space is limited and the government should focus on the composition of expenditure and taxes to support growth. Public investment has been squeezed to meet deficit targets and its planned increase in 2017 is welcome, as it can support growth without weakening the fiscal position. However, achieving permanent reductions in current expenditures, notably regarding staff spending, would free up resources for still more productive spending. Pursuing a comprehensive expenditure review could also lead to efficiency gains. On the tax side, the projected shift from income to consumption taxes is welcome as it will support production by reducing distortions. Additional revenue could be raised by reducing exemptions and limiting the use of reduced rates.</p>

Additional revenue should be raised with reforms to the VAT, the taxation of state-owned enterprises, higher taxation on the hydrocarbon sector and higher excise taxes. Over the medium term, re-establishing fiscal rules that limit the pro-cyclical use of oil revenue would contribute to raise fiscal room for bad times. </emphasis>

The financing of the deficit through the Reserve Fund is not sustainable, as the Fund is expected to be exhausted by 2018. At the same time, the ambitious fiscal consolidation plan for 2017-2020, implying a freeze of nominal spending and a decline of the fiscal deficit by 1 percentage point of GDP per year, might delay the recovery. Fiscal policy is projected to be less stringent than planned in 2017-18. An important challenge for Russia is to find fiscal room in the new environment of lower oil prices.</p>

Measures to tackle the grey economy and to raise non-oil taxation, especially excise taxes, environmental taxes and VAT, would raise revenue on a sustainable basis. Regarding spending, the large subsidies to state-owned enterprises should be curtailed in favour of spending on education and health. In the medium term, re-establishing the three-year expenditure framework and the expenditure rule, both recently suspended, would limit pro-cyclical spending.</p>

Inflationary pressures have fallen with the stabilisation of the rouble, and hence the central bank should be ready to ease its stance as inflation expectations decline. Large liquidity inflows to state-owned enterprises and banks during the recession have resulted in fast credit growth and an increasing share of non-performing loans that now require attention.</p>

Lower inflation and stronger wage increases, on the back of stronger business activity, will support consumption growth and business confidence. The assumed stabilised exchange rate and lower interest rates will boost investment. Export growth will rise on the back of a still weak rouble and stronger world trade. However, this boost will remain moderate as the lack of structural reforms and a poor business climate impede diversification. The rise in the poverty rate is expected to stabilise as growth accelerates at the end of the projection period.</p>

Upside risks are associated with stronger export growth than projected and the possible firming of oil prices if the major oil producing countries manage to limit supply. The projection also assumes renewed economic sanctions and no major structural reforms. An easing of sanctions would improve the business climate and potential growth. A stronger slowdown in China would weigh on exports and the normalisation of US monetary policy comes with the risk of renewed rouble depreciation and another burst of inflation. </p>

However, more ambitious national structural reforms are needed to ensure that the benefits of higher growth are shared equitably, making it more inclusive and sustainable. Despite a recent decline, the share of the long-term unemployed remains high. More changes are needed to increase the efficiency of public employment services, with more resources allocated towards effective training measures.

This should focus on improving the outcomes of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including Roma, by easing their access to early childhood education. </p>

This may not suffice to stabilise the economy as slack disappears. The structural deficit will remain above the 1% of GDP stipulated in the EU’s fiscal rules. Ratings agencies have upgraded government debt and interest rates have fallen, which will help reverse the sharp increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio and interest payments. Monetary conditions have improved as both bank lending rates and long-term interest rates have declined, which, combined with an ebbing of bank deleveraging, leaves firms with better access to financing. </p>

Nevertheless, one of the most rapidly ageing populations in Europe has already begun to take its toll on the labour force. Further reforms will be necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability in the longer term. Lowering the tax wedge could enhance the incentives for older workers to work, while greater investment in lifelong learning could increase their employability. </p>

Domestic demand will become the main driver of the expansion. Private consumption will accelerate on the back of higher incomes as wages increase in a tightening labour market. Investment will accelerate in 2017 as a new disbursement of EU structural funds bolsters infrastructure investments and firms exploit easier lending conditions to invest in response to capacity constraints. Exporters will continue to gain market shares as they benefit from past gains in competitiveness. However, falling unemployment will put upward pressure on wages and unit labour costs. </p>

A faster-than-projected recovery in export markets would bolster exports. Tighter-than-expected labour market bottlenecks could erode the recent gains in competitiveness. Renewed international financial turbulence could hurt lending conditions, which would have a negative impact on investment in Slovenia.</p>

A strict consolidation plan is being implemented to limit the deficit and stabilise public debt. Higher-than-expected government revenues in the first half of the year and continued restrictions on spending are improving fiscal outcomes for 2016 and 2017. Fiscal policy is projected to remain restrictive in 2017‑2018 to maintain credibility and reduce costs of borrowing. There is still room to increase the efficiency of spending and strengthen investment in infrastructure. Furthermore, more funds could be raised by allowing private sector participation in those state-owned enterprises which are servicing markets with a sufficient degree of competition or effective oversight by a regulator. </p>

Developing entrepreneurship through better training, vocational education and access to finance is key to reduce the high structural unemployment level.</p>

In a benign scenario, a downgrade would lead to a short-term spike in interest rates and a further weakening of the rand. In a more worrisome scenario, it could trigger a sharp reversal of capital flows and precipitate a recession. The main external risks are related to Brexit and unexpected increases in US interest rates that could have adverse effects on capital flows and the volatility of the rand. On the other hand, a normal rainy season would raise agricultural output and push down food prices. Also, if political developments stop affecting the rand, it should appreciate which would contribute to lower inflation.</p>

With public debt around 100% of GDP and the deficit still at slightly below 5% of GDP, the scope for fiscal expansion is limited. It is nevertheless important to stimulate growth by shifting spending towards growth-enhancing outlays, such as education, active labour market policies and R&amp;D, which are all below those in peer countries after having fallen substantially since the crisis. The structure of taxation remains tilted towards labour income which penalises growth and employment, and the tax burden should be shifted towards consumption and environmental taxes.</emphasis>

Business investment growth has continued its dynamic pace supported by favourable financial conditions, solid profit margins and reduced indebtedness. Residential investment has become more positive as households and non-financial corporations have taken advantage of easier financing conditions. Exports are benefitting from gains in competitiveness and from a significant expansion of export markets in recent years. Moderate wage growth has helped preserve competitiveness. Inflation has recently turned positive, but remains moderate owing to low energy prices and still significant slack.</p>

The budget deficit is expected to decline to 4.6% of GDP in 2016 from 5.1% in 2015, driven by dynamic growth and some consolidation measures, including expenditure cuts and recent amendments to the corporate income tax to make up for a loss in revenue following the 2015 reform. The fiscal stance will provide modest support in 2017 and 2018. While more demand is needed to raise growth further and reduce unemployment significantly, high debt and deficits limit the scope for fiscal expansion. Any available fiscal space should be used to finance initiatives leading to faster and more inclusive growth. Priorities for higher spending include strengthening vocational education and training and active labour market programmes to effectively fight youth and long-term unemployment. Fighting poverty, especially among families with children, by strengthening minimum income support programmes should also be a priority, as both poverty and inequality have worsened after the crisis. </p>

This should be combined with reforms of the tax and spending structure that promote growth. Further tax reform could reduce social security contributions on low-wage workers, broaden the income, corporate and value-added tax bases and make greater use of environmentally-related taxes, which are under-exploited. Exemptions and reduced rates significantly reduce VAT revenues and the new government should reassess the merits of reduced rates and start by progressively eliminating those that mainly benefit higher-income households. Spain has considerable scope to rely more on environmentally-related taxes, which would enhance investment incentives and help reduce the negative impact of growth on the environment. There is scope to raise taxes on fuel for road transport and to increase the taxation of diesel.</p>

Unemployment is gradually declining, but the unemployed increasingly consist of harder-to-employ individuals, including recently arrived immigrants. Efforts to maintain cost-competitiveness in manufacturing, where weak global demand toughens competition, together with low short-term inflation expectations, hold back wage growth, which restrains private consumption growth. Inflation has stayed low and monetary policy has accordingly remained highly expansionary, which is boosting investment and asset prices.</p>

Immigration rejuvenates the Swedish population and, in the longer term, will increase employment, provided that integration is successful. The use of fiscal space to accommodate temporary costs related to reception and integration may allow for less aggressive monetary policy. The decision to lower the fiscal surplus target from 1% to 0.33% of GDP increases fiscal space slightly over the coming years. The repo rate has stood at -0.50% since mid-February, driving up prices and inflation expectations, but recent readings have been weak.</p>

Macro-prudential measures, including a mortgage amortisation requirement, have been taken. Supplementing existing measures by a debt-to-income cap should be considered. Steps to increase housing supply and ease planning regulations are welcome. Removing the ceiling of the property tax or phasing out mortgage interest deductibility would damp housing price increases, improve capital allocation and increase redistribution. Easing rental regulations would improve the utilisation of the existing housing stock.</p>

Unemployment will level out, as an increasing share of the unemployed will be low-educated or recent immigrants. Real wage increases are contained by the leading role in collective bargaining of the export industry, which is exposed to tough global competition. However, nominal wages are set to accelerate, as expansionary monetary policy increases inflation expectations.

Indeed, Swiss foreign currency reserves have increased by more than 15% in the past year. The risks posed by negative interest rates have not materialised so far, although they are rising, notably for the financial sector. However, the possibility of additional central bank stimulus is limited. The authorities should stand ready to reinforce macro-prudential measures, as mortgage rates are very low and debt relatively high.</p>

Public debt and the fiscal position are sound. Debt servicing costs have fallen from 1.3% of GDP in 2005 to 0.6% in 2015. The fiscal space should be utilised to revive public investment with a view to boosting sustainable and inclusive growth. There is also room to increase the provision of early childhood education and care, especially for migrants. Through 2015-16, income tax receipts have surged as firms and individuals have paid taxes in advance and delayed withdrawing tax credits because of negative interest rates; however, this should be reversed starting in 2018. In addition, the 2016 corporate tax reform, while welcome, will translate into lower government revenues.</p>

Fiscal policy was expansionary in 2016, mainly through increased public sector wages and social transfers, and expenditures for refugees. The share of primary general government spending in GDP is expected to increase from around 38% in 2015 to around 41% in 2016 and 2017, before falling below 40% in 2018. Monetary policy was loosened, despite above-target inflation and inflation expectations, with the average funding rate of the central bank cut by about 100 basis points between March and October. Prudential rules were relaxed, with an extension of term limits on consumer loans and credit cards. Tax amnesties, additional tax cuts and new subsidies were also offered to businesses. A more fundamental upgrading of the business environment through structural and institutional reform would give additional stimulus to business investment.</p>

This projection is subject to above-average special risks. Military activity has increased across the south-eastern border, and a constitutional referendum might be held in 2017. Related developments will affect household and business confidence, and will bear on consumption, investment and growth.</p>
          <p id="ID4afa4aeb-4c3b-4a1b-a82c-648ed082e80a" instlang="en" indent="y" numbering="n">Uncertainties will also affect external funding. The current account deficit fell from 8% of GDP in 2013 to an estimated 4.6% in 2016. However, external debt roll-over needs are high. In the current circumstances, preserving the credibility of economic policy institutions is crucial. The cautious implementation of the Medium-Term Economic Programme, the alignment of national accounts with international standards and related improvement in fiscal transparency, and the actual implementation of the announced structural and institutional reforms would strengthen internal and external confidence and reduce foreign funding risks. On the upside, diplomatic rapprochement with some neighboring countries may improve trade prospects faster than foreseen, not only for goods but also for tourism and other services. </p>

          <emphasis emph="bold">The Brexit referendum vote has reduced growth prospects and increased volatility, as reflected by the large currency depreciation. Monetary policy has mitigated the immediate impact of the shock by stabilising financial markets and shoring up consumer confidence. This projection assumes the United Kingdom will operate with a most favoured nation status after 2019, but there is considerable uncertainty about this, which will increasingly weigh on growth, and in particular private investment, including foreign direct investment. Higher inflation is projected to hit households’ purchasing power and to reduce corporate margins, weakening private consumption and investment. As growth slows, the unemployment rate is projected to rise. </emphasis>

          <emphasis emph="bold">Macroeconomic policies need to be expansionary. Inflation is set to exceed the target of 2%, but the monetary policy stance is expected to be unchanged as the inflationary impact of currency depreciation should be temporary. The latest government plans released in the Autumn Statement indicate a slower pace of fiscal consolidation and some increase in public investment. A more significant increase in public investment would support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term. With a weak economic outlook, further raises in the minimum wage should be considered prudently. </emphasis>

More spending on physical infrastructure and skills in regions lagging behind would raise productivity and wages, making fiscal policy more inclusive.</emphasis>

Monetary stimulus has, however, eased the near-term drag on growth from the decision to leave the European Union.

Uncertainty about the United Kingdom’s relationships with the rest of the world is high, and the risk of exit from the European Union’s single market and customs union has pushed the exchange rate to new lows and lifted long-term interest rates.</p>

Real wages have been growing at a time of low inflation, but the fall of the exchange rate has started to increase price pressures. Caution is needed with the implementation of the policy to raise the National Living Wage to 60% of median hourly earnings by 2020. The effects on employment need to be carefully assessed before any further increases are adopted, especially as growth slows and labour markets weaken. Rolling out the universal credit should sharpen work incentives, but better skills are also needed to create better jobs. The planned introduction of an apprenticeship levy on large businesses will be an important step to support the development of vocational skills across all firms. Higher spending on active labour market policies would help upskilling and the reallocation of labour from the non-tradable to the tradable sectors underpinned by a weaker exchange rate, which should enhance productivity over time.</p>

Some discretionary fiscal measures will be used to increase infrastructure spending, which should support short-run economic activity and enhance long-term growth, but further fiscal tightening is planned overall by the authorities.</p>

Inflation is expected to exceed the 2% inflation target, but the extent of monetary stimulus should be maintained to ease the cost of economic adjustment to the departure from the European Union.</p>

Private consumption growth is projected to slow, as the currency depreciation that has already taken place reduces real earnings growth.

Uncertainty could hamper domestic and foreign investment more than projected and the pass-through of currency depreciation to prices could be larger, deepening the extent of stagflation. Subdued world trade growth could limit the effect of depreciation on exports. The large current account deficit may be harder to finance, although weaker-than-projected consumption and imports would reduce the deficit eventually. Improved prospects of an orderly exit from the European Union while retaining strong trade linkages with the bloc would support near-term growth more than projected.</p>

Residential investment has been modest by historical standards, though there are signs that activity may be picking up as supply bottlenecks are overcome. Business investment has also been sluggish, but some signs - such as strengthening R&amp;D spending – suggest it will accelerate. Household spending remained strong, however, benefitting from employment and wage gains as well as an increase in purchasing power due to the fall in energy prices. Weak external demand and the exchange rate appreciation constrained export growth during much of 2016, while the slowdown in import-intensive investment has weighed on imports.</p>

Inflation overshoots the target during the projections, though the monetary tightening, fading of the fiscal impulse and anchored expectations will return it towards target in the medium term. The gradual rise in interest rates will begin to reduce some of the financial distortions that have emerged under a policy of sustained very low interest rates. Concerns about valuations of commercial real estate have already prompted regulators to issue guidance and prudential regulation should remain ready to counter emerging threats if needed. </p>

The fiscal stance is projected to shift in 2017 from broadly neutral to expansionary. This will stimulate economic activity and ease some of the burden that has been placed on monetary policy. Partly because of this stimulus, government debt is projected to inch up only slightly. Nevertheless, in the long term, mandatory spending will begin to rise more strongly under current policy settings, and fiscal adjustment of some sort will be needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. </p>

The boost to spending on infrastructure and other investments (such as improving skills and facilitating job finding success through more active labour market policies and the provision of child care) will combat inequality and counter the steady decline in labour force participation rates, both by prime-age men and women. Investment in public infrastructure, such as mass transit systems, will also be needed to move towards a more environmentally sustainable economy. Reforms to personal and corporate taxation could enhance efficiency by lowering marginal rates and removing provisions that narrow the tax base and invite tax avoidance. </p>

Indeed, projected fiscal support will boost GDP growth by just under ½ and 1 percentage point in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Household spending continues at a healthy pace, supported by the tax cuts, employment gains and strengthening wage growth boosting household disposable income. Furthermore, tightening labour market conditions will encourage greater labour force participation as discouraged workers return. Business investment is expected to surge with cuts to corporate income tax (assumed to be part of a fiscal stimulus package) and as demand growth recovers.</p>

The fiscal stimulus of the new Administration may be bigger or smaller than assumed in the projections. Labour market slack may evaporate more quickly and wage growth could rise more rapidly than anticipated, stoking stronger inflationary pressures and requiring the Federal Reserve to react more strongly. On the other hand, weakening external demand and further appreciation of the dollar could create a drag on net exports and depress investment, creating disinflationary pressures and requiring macroeconomic policy to become more accommodative. Disruptions to international trade, including breaking global value chains would hurt growth. There are also risks of financial market turbulence as the Federal Reserve begins tightening. In particular, as policy in other major currency areas is projected to remain very accommodative, the divergence with the United States could unleash unpredictable market reactions and financial flows. </p>

This implies that differences between adjusted and unadjusted annual data may occur, though these in general are quite small. In some countries, official forecasts of annual figures do not include working-day adjustments. Even when official forecasts do adjust for working days, the size of the adjustment may in some cases differ from that used by the OECD.</p>
