                        Growth</emphasis> was launched in 2005 as a new form of structural
                    surveillance complementing the OECD's long­standing country and sector­specific
                    surveys. In line with the OECD's 1960 founding Convention, the aim is to help
                    promote vigorous sustainable economic growth and improve the well­being of OECD
                    citizens.</p>
        <p id="OCDEid1064673" instlang="en" numbering="n" indent="y">This surveillance is based on a
                    systematic and in­depth analysis of structural policies and their outcomes
                    across OECD members, relying on a set of internationally comparable and
                    regularly updated policy indicators with a well­established link to performance.
                    Using these indicators, alongside the expertise of OECD committees and staff,
                    policy priorities and recommendations are derived for each member and, starting
                    from the 2011 edition, six key non­member economies with which the OECD works
                    closely (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa). From one
                    issue to the next, <emphasis emph="normal">Going for Growth</emphasis> follows
                    up on these recommendations and priorities evolve, not least as a result of
                    governments taking action on the identified policy priorities. </p>
        <p id="OCDEid1057111" numbering="n" indent="y">Underpinning this type of benchmarking is the
                    observation that drawing lessons from mutual success and failure is a powerful
                    avenue for progress. While allowance should be made for genuine differences in
                    social preferences across OECD members, the uniqueness of national circumstances
                    should not serve to justify inefficient policies. </p>
        <p id="OCDEid1057125" numbering="n" indent="y">In gauging performance, the focus is on GDP per
                    capita, productivity and employment. As highlighted in the past and again in
                    this issue, this leaves out some important dimensions of well­being. For this
                    reason, Going for Growth regularly features thematic chapters dedicated to these
                    other dimensions, and increasingly looks at the side effects of growth­enhancing
                    priorities on other government policy objectives. </p>

                    Difference</mainhead>
      </heading>
      <p id="o12-2012-03-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0001" numbering="n" indent="y">The uncertainty surrounding
                world economic prospects for the coming year and beyond is unusually high. This is
                largely because the course economic policies will take in major OECD economies
                remains unclear. Worst­case outcomes can be forestalled provided monetary policy
                remains very supportive, sovereign debt and banking sector problems in the euro area
                are contained, and excessive fiscal tightening is avoided where there is room to
                proceed gradually, not least in the United States. But even then unemployment would
                stay high through 2013, there would be no prospect of recovering the output foregone
                with the crisis, and public budgets would remain on unsustainable paths across most
                of the OECD. Even under a more optimistic scenario, underpinned by a decisive
                resolution of the crisis in the euro area, the need to work off the divergence in
                cost competitiveness among member countries could still produce economic and
                political headwinds. On the other hand, failing to address such divergence would
                keep in place the fundamental imbalances that have led to the current crisis. More
                generally, growth needs to be lifted in most advanced economies and made more
                sustainable in most emerging markets. </p>
      <p id="o12-2012-03-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0002" numbering="n" indent="y">The structural reform priorities
                we have identified in <emphasis emph="normal">Going for Growth</emphasis> are key to
                addressing these issues in OECD and non­OECD countries. In separate work we carried
                out as part of the G20 Mutual Assessment Process, we estimated that a broad and
                ambitious reform agenda could raise annual GDP growth by as much as one per cent on
                average across the OECD over the next ten years. In the BRIICS, product market
                liberalisation could deliver sizeable gains as well, both in terms of growth and
                global rebalancing. Productivity­enhancing reforms, not least a reduction in entry
                barriers in product markets, can go some way towards restoring the external
                competitiveness of those European countries hit by the sovereign debt crisis,
                provided complementary labour market reforms ensure wage moderation. More generally,
                growth­enhancing structural reforms should be an essential part of the policy action
                needed to put the euro area on a sustainable path. </p>
      <p id="o12-2012-03-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0003" numbering="n" indent="y">Some of our <emphasis emph="normal">Going for Growth</emphasis> recommendations would also mitigate
                risks that higher unemployment turns structural. In particular, sheltering active
                labour market policies from ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts – and indeed
                strengthening them where possible – would help job seekers find new jobs more
                quickly and ensure that those at risk of discouragement remain attached to the
                labour market. And in economies that experience renewed economic set­backs, it will
                be important to build on the lessons from the crisis in terms of what works to
                cushion the labour market impact of adverse economic shocks, such as making use of
                short­time working schemes and, more broadly, of state­contingent policies.</p>
      <p id="o12-2012-03-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0004" numbering="n" indent="y">The good news is that
                governments are now acting more forcefully on the structural front than they did
                before or in the early stages of the crisis. This year’s edition of <emphasis emph="normal">Going for Growth</emphasis> provides a unique and detailed review
                of the policy measures taken by each country since the start of the crisis in 2007.
                This stocktaking exercise shows that the pace of structural reform has clearly
                accelerated over the past two years. Even more encouraging, this acceleration has
                also taken place where it is most needed, not least in some of the most affected
                euro area countries.</p>
      <p id="o12-2012-03-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0005" numbering="n" indent="y">One often voiced and legitimate
                concern is that structural reforms could initially deepen the slump. The truth is
                that economic theory is thin and empirical evidence virtually non­existent on the
                short­term effects of reforms. Our new research, gathered in a special chapter,
                fills some of this gap and delivers an optimistic message: fears that reforms may
                depress economic activity in the short run are overblown. Indeed among the wide
                range of reforms we looked at, none was found to have had systematic adverse
                short­term effects in the past, while many quickly stimulated output and employment.
                At the same time, our analysis suggests that some labour market reforms can indeed
                be temporarily detrimental if implemented in bad times. Where possible, these should
                wait until the labour market improves decisively, and be preceded by product and
                financial market reforms. Another important implication of our analysis is that a
                comprehensive reform package is necessary to alleviate the adverse short­term
                effects of some reforms while contributing to kick-start the economy, especially
                through investment induced by stronger product market competition. In any event,
                effective communication and consensus building are of the essence to foster the
                confidence households need to take advantage of reform­driven income gains.</p>
      <p id="o12-2012-03-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0006" numbering="n" indent="y">Another legitimate concern is
                that reforms may harm the least well­off. Income inequality was already on the rise
                in most OECD countries before the crisis, and it has likely risen further in its
                aftermath. It is also a major issue in the BRIICS. Two special chapters in this
                report yield encouraging lessons regarding what reforms do to inequality both in the
                long term and in the wake of macroeconomic shocks like financial crises. We find
                that several reforms, notably enhancing the quality and equity of secondary
                education, liberalising product markets and making employment protection legislation
                more uniform across workers, appear to have favourable growth and distributive
                impacts. Some tax reforms can also be beneficial on both grounds. Starting with a
                drastic cut in tax expenditures would seem especially warranted at the current
                juncture, not least since it would also help fiscal consolidation. Now not all
                growth­friendly reforms would yield such double or triple dividends, of course. In
                particular, it remains challenging to design tax and transfer systems in ways that
                are conducive to both higher growth and lower inequality. For one, the experience of
                some Nordic countries shows that it can be done. And again, broad reform packages
                including win­win policies could deliver on both goals.</p>
      <p id="o12-2012-03-1-fmt-forwd-s01-p0007" numbering="n" indent="y">As mentioned at the outset, the
                global economy could take different paths in the coming months depending on the
                decisiveness and effectiveness of policy action. While this requires appropriate and
                possibly bold contributions by macroeconomic policies, structural reforms are
                necessary both to accelerate the exit from the deep phase of the crisis, especially
                in some regions, and to make longer term growth stronger, more sustainable, and
                possibly less unequal.</p>

                        policy challenges, but it has also made the necessity of structural reforms
                        more apparent. This initial chapter of <emphasis emph="normal">Going for
                            Growth</emphasis> assesses progress that countries have made in
                        structural reforms since the start of the crisis, covering the whole

                        lesson emerging from the analysis is that the crisis and ensuing recession
                        have acted as a catalyst for structural reforms, especially in
                        OECD countries where reforms were most needed. In particular, the depth of
                        the labour market crisis has provided an impetus for structural reforms
                        aimed at raising labour utilisation. The need to consolidate public finances
                        and the financial pressure arising from mushrooming sovereign debt have
                        given another impetus to reform, with a clear acceleration of politically
                        sensitive reforms designed to help lift potential growth, regain price
                        competitiveness and restore fiscal sustainability, especially in some euro
                        area countries.</p>

                        should be given to boosting jobs in the context of ongoing fiscal
                        consolidation. For now, there is a clear case for sheltering activation
                        policies aimed at retraining displaced workers and encouraging return to
                        work from fiscal consolidation efforts. And in countries that experience
                        renewed economic set­backs it will be important to build on the lessons from
                        the financial crisis in terms of policies that can help cushion the labour
                        market and social impact of weak activity, such as making use of short­time
                        working schemes. Tax reforms, not least a reduction in tax expenditures and
                        a shift in the tax burden away from labour, could help kick­start the jobs
                        recovery and assist fiscal consolidation. Product market reforms could also
                        boost short­term growth, especially if implemented in sheltered sectors
                        where the potential to quickly create jobs is relatively high, such as
                        retail trade and professional services.</p>

                                measures that extend GDP numbers to non­market production, and

                                explored in last year’s edition of Going for Growth. While many
                                alternative well­being measures are correlated with GDP per capita
                                (see OECD, 2006, <emphasis emph="italic">Going for

                                to evaluate issues such as, for example, income distribution,
                                poverty, or environmental sustainability. On the latter issue, the

                        were first identified in 2005, which were then reassessed in the 2007,
                        2009 and 2011 editions based on both observed progress in reform and new

                        broad overview of the progress that countries have made in structural
                        reforms since the start of the crisis, covering the whole period 2007­11.
                        This crisis has raised new structural policy challenges, such as reviving
                        economies and consolidating public finances in a way that also fosters
                        sustainable long­term growth. At the same time, it has also made the
                        necessity of reforms such as those identified in <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> more apparent – for example pension reforms
                        that would boost labour utilisation while addressing fiscal sustainability
                        concerns. The five­year retrospective allows identifying reform patterns
                        throughout the various phases of the crisis, from which political economy
                        lessons can be drawn. As a tool for structural surveillance, this analysis
                        aims primarily at taking stock of reforms carried out in areas that had been
                        previously identified as priorities in <emphasis emph="italic">Going for
                            Growth</emphasis>. At the same time, however, the crisis induced timely

                                reforms have varied markedly throughout the distinct phases of the
                                crisis. The 2008 recession first slowed down structural reforms in
                                OECD countries, due to the pressing need to stabilise aggregate
                                demand and provide income support to the unemployed. As the need for
                                medium­term fiscal consolidation became more pressing, reforms were
                                implemented in policy areas which could help assist the fiscal
                                adjustment process. This was the case with respect to both
                                labour­utilisation (retirement schemes and welfare systems) and
                                labour­productivity (public sector reforms and privatisation

                                contrast to what was observed before the crisis, lower­income

                                accompanies and facilitates reforms. Indeed, there is a strong

                                This pattern is driven mostly by the actions taken in countries

                                for job­search assistance and training programmes in order to
                                facilitate re­employment and re­deployment. To stimulate labour
                                demand, work­sharing arrangements were introduced or expanded in
                                two­thirds of OECD countries, labour taxes were cut and new job or
                                hiring subsidy schemes were introduced, often targeting marginal job
                                seekers such as youth, older workers, or the long­term unemployed.
                                Some temporary measures were subsequently phased out, and difficult
                                labour market reforms were implemented in the areas of retirement
                                schemes, job protection, minimum wages and wage bargaining systems,
                                especially in the context of the European debt crisis.</p>

                            indicators of performance, OECD countries’ patterns of labour
                            utilisation and productivity have remained quite stable despite the
                            depth of the crisis (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-s02-01-g001" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>, Panel A). Some exceptions stand out though, reflecting large
                            differences across OECD member countries in the magnitude of the decline
                            in output and the way labour markets responded to it. For instance,
                            Ireland experienced a major decline in GDP per capita as a result of the
                            crisis, which turned the positive income gap with respect to the
                            upper­half of the OECD into a negative one. There was also a substantial
                            reduction in the United States’ lead in labour utilisation over the
                            crisis period, reflecting a large increase in unemployment and a
                            significant decline in labour force participation. The impact of the
                            crisis has been both milder and shorter in the BRIICS countries. This
                            has allowed them to continue to converge rapidly with OECD GDP per
                            capita levels, mostly thanks to rising labour productivity.
                            Nevertheless, for almost all the BRIICS, income is still 60%­90% lower
                            than the upper half of OECD countries, mainly owing to labour
                            productivity shortfalls. In this respect they are similar to the
                            lower­income OECD countries. Low labour resource utilisation is also a
                            particularly large challenge in South Africa (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-s02-01-g001" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>, Panel B).</p>

                            OECD countries since 2007, with the share of productivity­enhancing
                            recommendations remaining at approximately 60% (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-s02-01-t00" format="Table" object="table" type="sing" cont="no"/>). This ratio
                            slightly increased in the most recent rounds, reflecting new priorities
                            in public sector efficiency, taxation structure, infrastructure, housing
                            and social mobility. This was partly following new empirical research in
                            these domains, as well as reflecting policy lessons emerging from the
                            recent crisis. The predominance of labour productivity­enhancing
                            challenges is more pronounced among the lower­income OECD economies.
                            While detailed priorities vary widely across OECD countries depending on
                            their particular performance and policy weaknesses, relaxing
                            anti­competitive product market regulations and reforming social benefit
                            systems are fairly common recommendations for raising productivity and
                            labour utilisation, respectively.</p>
            <p id="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-s02-02-p0166" numbering="n" indent="y">For the BRIICS,
                            four­fifths of the policy recommendations are aimed at improving
                            productivity, reflecting these countries’ relative weakness in this area
                                (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-s02-01-g001" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>, Panel B).
                            There is a strong focus on product market regulation, which is often
                            much more stringent than in upper­income OECD countries; and education
                            systems, where quality and achievement levels are relatively low.
                            Government/governance reform, strengthening intellectual property rights
                            protection and basic financial liberalisation are also common
                            recommendations for boosting productivity in the BRIICS. There are fewer
                            recommendations aimed at enhancing labour utilisation than for
                            OECD countries in general and the lower­income OECD countries in
                            particular, partly because most of the BRIICS have relatively high
                            overall employment rates. Instead, a number of recommendations are
                            intended to address the major challenge of labour informality. These
                            include increasing the coverage of social protection systems or
                            containing labour costs and relaxing overly strict job protection for
                            formal workers.</p>

                                    the extent to which countries have followed up on <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> priorities may be
                                    shaped by the nature of the recommendations. For instance, a
                                    country with recommendations in the areas of innovation and
                                    public sector efficiency might be expected to be more responsive
                                    than another country with similar appetite for reform but with
                                    priorities in the areas of job protection and wage formation,
                                    where political economy obstacles to reform are stronger. In
                                    order to account for this possibility a

                                    has also been computed. This weighs responsiveness on each
                                    individual priority according to the difficulty of undertaking
                                    the relevant reform. The difficulty is measured by the average
                                    responsiveness to priorities in this area across the OECD.</p>

                                    carried over the same period by the Business and Industry
                                    Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC) in its Member and Observer

                                    countries and certain emerging economies. The latter survey
                                    suggests that BIAC Member/Observer organisations perceive that
                                    most <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis>
                                    priorities have been addressed. Indeed, 69% of the reform
                                    priorities are considered to have been partly implemented
                                    since 2007, which is consistent with significant reform activity
                                    over the period considered. BIAC Member/Observer organisations
                                    rarely consider that <emphasis emph="italic">Going for

                                    current finding that policy action has been often piecemeal and
                                    that it rarely would imply the removal of the corresponding
                                    priority.</p></note> Compared with the pre­crisis period, responsiveness rates have
                            increased on average to <emphasis emph="italic">Going for
                                Growth</emphasis> recommendations for enhancing both labour
                            productivity and labour utilisation. For the latter, this partly
                            reflects recent extensive labour market reforms undertaken in the
                            context of the euro area debt crisis. Reform activity has gone through
                            distinct phases since the start of the crisis (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-s03-02-g003" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>). At first the
                            recession markedly slowed action on <emphasis emph="italic">Going for
                                Growth </emphasis>priorities, probably reflecting much greater
                            policy focus on macroeconomic stabilisation. The pace of reform slowed
                            down most in the labour productivity area and less so for labour
                            utilisation. The subsequent period saw reform action accelerate
                            strongly, with the bounce­back strongest in reforms to boost labour
                            productivity, such as product market or public sector reforms aimed at
                            increasing efficiency.</p>

                            past efforts and the country’s relatively good overall economic
                            performance. Since 2010, there has been a major acceleration in reform

                            especially for labour utilisation, and so does Spain. The acute crisis

                                    has been progress since 2007 in reducing financial disincentives

                                    priority. The crisis and the ensuing fiscal sustainability
                                    problems in many OECD countries have led to an acceleration of
                                    pension reforms over the most recent period. Major reforms have
                                    been implemented in European countries, especially – but not
                                    exclusively – in EU­IMF programme countries (see <xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-bs02" format="Box" object="box" type="sing" cont="no"/>). Some of the reforming
                                    countries phased out or restricted access to early retirement
                                    schemes by tightening eligibility conditions (Austria, Belgium,
                                    Greece, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Spain) or progressively
                                    closing <emphasis emph="italic">de facto</emphasis> early
                                    retirement routes by abolishing job­search exemptions for older
                                    unemployed (France). Others raised minimum and statutory
                                    retirement ages (Belgium for females, France, Greece, Hungary
                                    and Spain), or sought to increase the effective retirement age
                                    by lengthening contribution requirements to claim full pensions
                                    (France, Greece and Spain), reducing the level of pension
                                    benefits (Greece and Hungary), or adjusting benefits or the
                                    retirement age in line with life expectancy (Greece, Norway and
                                    Spain). Reforms aimed at enhancing the long­term sustainability
                                    of public pensions systems have in some cases been accompanied
                                    by concomitant backtracking with the downsizing of the

                                    Eastern European countries. Among the OECD countries that had a

                                    diverted contributions from the private to the public pillar. In

                                    policy priority, the phasing­in of the pension reform remains

                                    notable feature of this crisis has been that older workers have
                                    remained in the labour market, contrary to the experiences of
                                    previous recessions, where early retirement incentives sometimes
                                    encouraged labour market withdrawal (OECD, 2011b, 2011d
                                    and 2011e). This may reflect not just the comparatively mild
                                    deterioration in labour market conditions (given the magnitude
                                    of the recession) in a number of OECD countries, but also the
                                    benefits of recent reforms. Still, given that severe recessions
                                    have in the past led to significant labour market withdrawal
                                    with a notable lag (Duval <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011), further reductions of financial
                                    disincentives to continued work – not least faster phasing out
                                    of special or <emphasis emph="italic">de facto</emphasis> early
                                    retirement routes – would help ensure that laid­off older
                                    workers remain attached to the labour market. Furthermore, such
                                    reforms would improve the long­run sustainability of pension
                                    systems, which recent OECD analysis (OECD, 2011e, <emphasis emph="italic">OECD Pensions at a Glance 2011</emphasis>)
                                    shows is not currently ensured. Such reforms can be designed in
                                    ways that protect the most vulnerable (low income earners and
                                    people with interrupted careers), as has been done in some OECD

                                    Nevertheless, given the highly persistent employment impact of
                                    the crisis in some countries, STW schemes may have protected
                                    permanent jobs and prevented large income losses where they were
                                    in place. New STW schemes were introduced in Poland,
                                    the Netherlands, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
                                    the Slovak Republic, Mexico and New Zealand. In addition, many
                                    countries extended the coverage or generosity of existing
                                    schemes, or relaxed eligibility or administrative requirements
                                    in order to encourage take­up. The share of employees
                                    participating in pre­existing STW schemes expanded substantially
                                    in Belgium, Germany, Finland, Italy, Japan and Luxembourg,

                                    crisis (OECD, 2010b; Hijzen and Venn, 2011). Although an
                                    empirical assessment of the long­term effects of STW schemes is
                                    not yet available, the crisis experience suggests that having
                                    such options in place and being able to activate them in severe
                                    downturns can be useful, insofar as they may avoid losses of
                                    specific human capital in the wake of shocks that are temporary
                                    and do not imply a need for reallocation.</p>

                                    effects. Also, such schemes may work more effectively when
                                    implemented in the context of wage bargaining that provide
                                    individual firms more leeway (such as opt­out clauses) in the
                                    application of collective agreements, as this will allow for
                                    greater flexibility in the determination of working conditions
                                    during the operation of such schemes. For example, in Germany,
                                    those measures complemented spontaneous private­sector
                                    adjustment in average hours worked, the implementation of which
                                    was facilitated by collective agreements.</p>

                                    contracts. In Portugal, the 2009 job protection reform, which
                                    implied a substantial easing of job protection on regular
                                    contracts through a simplification of dismissal procedures, is
                                    being followed up – as part of the EU­IMF financial assistance
                                    package – by reductions in severance payments for regular
                                    contracts and a narrower definition of unfair dismissal. The
                                    Netherlands have been gradually reducing <emphasis emph="italic">de facto</emphasis> severance payments, first by reforming
                                    judicial procedures for local courts and then by introducing a
                                    cap (although limited to public and care sector workers). The
                                    Czech Republic also reformed severance payments by linking their
                                    level to job tenure. The provision for termination of a work
                                    contract by mutual consent was instituted in France in 2008 with

                                    had a limited impact on reducing dualism so far. Finally, some
                                    countries have sought to reduce labour market duality by
                                    strengthening training (Korea) or work­study schemes (France).
                                    Such measures are likely to work best if targeted to marginal
                                    groups in the labour market in order to enhance their regular
                                    employability. No actions were taken in respect of the priority

                                    Spain and South Africa in order to better align wages with
                                    firm­and regional­level productivity conditions and thereby
                                    encourage demand for low­skilled workers. Similarly to the trend
                                    observed in the area of job protection, responsiveness to such
                                    recommendations has been stronger during the crisis than before.
                                    Greece introduced sub­minimum wages for young workers and
                                    apprentices. While no change in this area has been achieved in
                                    Belgium, Finland decentralised wage bargaining, as did Australia
                                    by strengthening wage bargaining at the firm level, Italy by
                                    agreeing on a new labour contract promoting greater wage
                                    differentiation in the private sector and Spain by easing the
                                    conditions for firms to opt out from higher­level collective
                                    bargaining agreements. Reforms in this area have been
                                    accelerating over the past year, especially in southern European
                                    countries in need to regain competitiveness. Spain recently
                                    introduced a reform facilitating company­level agreements over
                                    any other negotiation level on issues such as wages and
                                    distribution of working time and accelerating arbitration
                                    procedures. Similarly, in Italy, the 2011 emergency budget
                                    allows local enterprise bargaining to undercut national wage
                                    agreements, provided a representative union in the firm accepts
                                    to opt out of the collective agreement and signs the new
                                    agreement with the employer. Responsiveness to priorities was
                                    more limited in the new OECD members and in Indonesia and
                                    South Africa since 2011, when associated <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> priorities were set. In
                                    South Africa, the <emphasis emph="italic">New Growth
                                        Pact</emphasis> strategy includes broad proposals to reform
                                    wage bargaining, which could help raise the very low employment
                                    rate in the formal sector. In Israel and Slovenia, increases in
                                    relative minimum wage levels were agreed for 2011 and 2012, in
                                    contrast with <emphasis emph="italic">Going for

                                    <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> priorities
                                in this area have focused somewhat more on boosting labour
                                utilisation. Responsiveness to these recommendations has clearly
                                increased over the past few years, possibly reflecting growing
                                recognition that badly designed policies contributed to the build­up
                                of housing bubbles. Some countries have been revising housing
                                subsidies (Iceland and the Slovak Republic), in some cases replacing
                                them with less distortive targeted cash benefits (Spain). The
                                United Kingdom simplified the planning process in order to increase
                                the responsiveness of housing supply to demand, while Sweden took
                                some actions to introduce market principles for municipal housing
                                companies. Some countries reduced tax distortions that favour home
                                ownership by reducing mortgage interest deductions from income
                                taxation (Denmark) or by equalising the tax treatment of rented and
                                owner­occupied housing (Spain). Rent regulations that prevent the
                                development of the rental market have been eased in the Netherlands,
                                Poland and Spain. No actions were taken in Luxembourg to address
                                housing rigidities.</p>

                                        Reducing the scope of public ownership has often been
                                        recommended as part of a broader policy package aimed at
                                        strengthening competition. Privatising SOEs could bring
                                        efficiency gains while helping restore the sustainability of
                                        public finances in cases where public administration and
                                        management had clearly proven to hurt efficiency.
                                        Well­designed privatisation processes, however, need to
                                        consider competition principles and apply competition law.
                                        Reducing the scope of public ownership has also been
                                        specifically advised to some OECD countries as well as
                                        in 2011 to China and Russia, where public ownership is
                                        particularly high. In China, private equity firms are
                                        progressively being allowed to restructure state­owned
                                        companies and the share of state capital in state­owned
                                        enterprises is being decreased. Italy privatised its public
                                        airline Alitalia in 2009. Mexico has been gradually
                                        increasing the independence and accountability of PEMEX, the
                                        national oil company. Privatisations took place in Poland
                                        and Turkey. More broadly, against the background of fiscal
                                        sustainability concerns, the crisis has accelerated the pace
                                        of privatisation, and especially so in European countries in
                                        the context of the sovereign debt crisis (see <xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01-bs02" format="Box" object="box" type="sing" cont="no"/>). In
                                        Russia, where State intervention remains pervasive, no
                                        significant progress has been recorded over the past

                                        undertaken in India since 2011 as well as in Japan through

                                the political difficulty of reform in this area, as also testify
                                increases in restrictions of agricultural exports in the past few
                                years. Agricultural subsidies have been mechanically reduced as a
                                consequence of higher world market prices. However, some progress
                                has also been made towards reducing the economic distortions
                                associated with policy interventions, <emphasis emph="italic">i.e.</emphasis> the composition of producer support to
                                agriculture has shifted from price support towards more direct
                                income support (European Union and Switzerland), and in some
                                countries new direct payments supplement existing market price
                                support measures (Japan and Korea). The European Union is
                                progressively decoupling producer support from production and will
                                abolish milk quotas by 2015. However, the renewed use of export
                                subsidies for dairy products in 2009 was a step back. Korea, Iceland
                                and Switzerland are reducing export subsidies and tariff and
                                non­tariff barriers. The United States went a step back in 2008 by
                                providing new incentives for the local production of cellulosic

                                has gained increasing prominence in the <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> exercise over the years. This
                                reflects mounting evidence of the impact of the tax structure on
                                economic growth (see <emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> Arnold
                                    <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011) and the
                                pressing need to restore fiscal sustainability in many
                                OECD countries, which calls for designing growth­friendly fiscal
                                consolidation strategies – or for implementing revenue­neutral tax
                                reforms where there is fiscal space. While Brazil took no action to
                                reduce the fragmentation and complexity of its tax system since 2011
                                (when the corresponding priority was set) reforms have been
                                widespread over the last five years in the 13 OECD countries where
                                improving the efficiency of the tax system had been identified as a
                                priority. Greece and Portugal have been implementing tax reforms
                                largely consistent with their <emphasis emph="italic">Going for
                                    Growth</emphasis> priorities. In particular, both countries have
                                sought to broaden the tax base by combating tax evasion (Greece) and
                                curbing tax expenditures (Portugal). Portugal also took action to
                                simplify tax collection and reduce tax compliance costs. In 2011,
                                Italy undertook a number of fiscal consolidation­driven tax changes
                                which should improve the efficiency of the tax structure, <emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> cutting labour and corporate taxes
                                along with raising value added tax (VAT) and local property tax
                                rates. In Germany and Finland, cuts in labour taxation implemented
                                as part of the crisis­related measures have been financed through
                                permanent increases in less distortive consumption and environmental
                                taxes. Canada and Israel have been reducing the corporate tax rate –
                                as well as personal income tax rates in the case of Israel, as will
                                Australia by 2013. Japan broadened the tax base by abolishing a
                                number of tax exemptions in 2010. Tax reform was also implemented in
                                Korea by broadening the consumption tax base and in Mexico, first by
                                reducing corporate tax loopholes and then by increasing the VAT rate
                                in 2010. Norway partly reformed its wealth tax system by bringing
                                the housing valuation component of the tax closer to market values.
                                No significant action was taken in the United States to address tax
                                distortions and broaden the tax base.</p>

                                        specifically identified as policy priorities for the
                                        European Union since 2007, and for Iceland and the
                                        United States against the background of the financial
                                        crisis. Most OECD countries – including those with a
                                        previous priority in this area – have taken steps towards
                                        overhauling financial supervision, in an attempt to correct
                                        some of the institutional failures that led to the financial
                                        crisis. Together with actions by individual countries and
                                        the European Union, a regulatory reform has been taking
                                        place at the international level in recognition of the need
                                        for co­ordinated rules to strengthen financial stability and
                                        reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. One vital
                                        component of such a regulatory regime has been the Basel III
                                        agreement, which effectively triples the size of capital
                                        reserves that banks must hold against losses over the

                                        supervision is particularly important for the euro area,

                                        recommended more basic financial liberalisation in most
                                        non­member economies, including Brazil and India, where bank
                                        credit is not fully allocated by the market. Since 2011, no
                                        action was taken in Brazil to reduce its very high level of
                                        reserve requirements, but the authorisation of credit
                                        registries should improve banks’ access to information on
                                        borrowers. Over the last year, India eased restrictions on

                                        of government expenditure had been recommended, likely
                                        reflecting the need to consolidate public budgets. General
                                        public sector reforms have included a rationalisation of
                                        public services (Hungary and Portugal) and introducing
                                        performance assessment (Portugal). Efficiency­enhancing
                                        public sector reforms have taken place in the healthcare
                                        sector through the re­organisation of public providers and
                                        the introduction of benchmarking (Hungary and New Zealand),
                                        patient co­payments (the Czech Republic) or the

                                        hospital sector. Since 2011, the Russian Federation has
                                        allowed citizens to choose a primary care doctor and an

                                        OECD and large emerging countries. Against the background of
                                        fiscal adjustment needs, raising expenditure on
                                        infrastructure has proven more challenging in the aftermath
                                        of crisis­related fiscal stimulus packages implemented in
                                        most OECD countries in 2008 and 2009 (see Chapter 1 in OECD,
                                        2010a). Policies to make cost­effective use of existing
                                        infrastructure have included the introduction of a combined
                                        property and water charge in 2012 (and meter­based water
                                        charges scheduled for 2013) in Ireland and the introduction
                                        of toll roads to restrain demand in Australia and
                                        New Zealand. Australia also focused on enhancing
                                        transparency in the selection of projects through the
                                        publication of cost­benefit analyses and <emphasis emph="italic">ex post</emphasis> evaluation mechanisms.
                                        While the UK government halted the trend increase in public
                                        investment amid austerity measures, Poland could rely on EU
                                        structural funds to continue upgrading its transport and
                                        communication infrastructure. In emerging economies, where
                                        enhancing infrastructure provision is key to boosting living
                                        standards and where public finances are generally in better
                                        shape, public spending on infrastructure continued to rise.
                                        At the same time, though, backtracking took place with
                                        respect to the opening of infrastructure industries to
                                        foreign investors, with India raising limits for foreign

                                        infrastructure companies and Brazil restricting private

                                is required to be subject to regulatory impact analysis, in order to

                        exercise seeks to identify five policy priorities for each OECD member
                        country, the BRIICS and the EU. Three of these policy priorities are
                        identified based on internationally comparable OECD indicators of policy
                        settings and performance. The additional two priorities are often supported
                        by indicator-based evidence, but may draw principally on country-specific
                        expertise. These priorities are meant to capture any potential policy
                        imperatives in fields not covered by indicators.</p>
          <p id="o12-2011-03-1-P00-a01-s00-p0626" numbering="n" indent="y">For the selection of the
                        three indicator-based policy priorities, the starting point is a detailed
                        examination of labour utilisation and productivity performance so as to
                        uncover specific areas of relative strength and weakness. Each performance
                        indicator is juxtaposed with corresponding policy indicators, where OECD
                        empirical research has shown a robust link to performance, to determine
                        where performance and policy weaknesses appear to be linked. This evaluation
                        process is carried out for each of the approximately 50 areas where OECD
                        policy indicators provide coverage.</p>
          <p id="o12-2011-03-1-P00-a01-s00-p0627" numbering="n" indent="y">As an example, <xref refid="o12-2011-03-1-P00-a01-s00-g011" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="none"/> below shows, for a sample
                        country, a scatter plot of pairings of policy indicators (on the horizontal
                        axis) with corresponding performance indicators (on the vertical axis).
                        Since many of the approximately 50 indicators are associated with more than
                        one performance area, there are potentially more than 100 potential pairings
                        to be examined. The indicators of policy and performance are standardised by
                        re-scaling them so that each has a mean of zero and a cross-county standard
                        deviation of one, with positive numbers representing positions more
                        growth-friendly than the OECD average. The scatter plot is thus divided into
                        four quadrants, depending on whether a country’s policy-performance pairing
                        is below or above the average policy or performance score.</p>

                        three unique policy areas that qualify as potential priorities (for
                        instance, Germany had 16 candidates in the 2009 exercise). When there are
                        more than three candidate policy priorities, the list has been narrowed
                        using a combination of country expertise with the following criteria:
                            <emphasis emph="italic">i</emphasis>) the estimated quantitative impact
                        of reforms in the policy area on GDP per capita as determined in previous
                        OECD analysis, <emphasis emph="italic">ii</emphasis>) the normalised
                        distance of the policy stance from the benchmark (the OECD average), and
                            <emphasis emph="italic">iii</emphasis>) recent trends in policy and
                        performance. The limit on the number of priorities means that for some
                        countries, obvious policy imperatives may not be identified as priorities
                        because other priorities are deemed as more important.</p>

                                job­search requirements have been gradually extended to age 58.
                                Similarly, the minimum age for early retirement was raised to 60 and
                                the legal retirement age of women was in several steps raised to
                                65 to be aligned with that of men. An in­work benefit for older
                                unemployed and a pension bonus for staying longer in the labour
                                market have been introduced. Thorough assessment of the early
                                retirement schemes is planned for late 2011.</p>

                                lowered the tax wedge. In 2012, despite the narrowing of the tax

                                will rise due to increased social security contributions and the

                                            sickness and disability benefit schemes and cuts in
                                            marginal taxes on labour income, as well as in improving
                                            the performance of the education system. By contrast,
                                            little has been achieved in terms of reforming
                                            employment protection legislation and reducing

                            result of an extra unit of national currency of labour income. The
                            difference is expressed as a percentage of the change in total labour
                            compensation. The value for India is equal to zero in 2010. For India,
                            the data refer to employees in the 95% of companies in the manufacturing
                            sector with less than ten employees. In firms with over 10 employees,
                            the tax wedge would be no more than 5%. In China, a significant portion

            <emphasis emph="italic">Not much is known about the short­term effects of structural reforms
                            whose benefits are expected in the long term. It has been argued that
                            some reforms could be detrimental at the current juncture, for instance
                            if they further weakened aggregate demand. This chapter presents new
                            empirical analysis drawn from 30 years of reform data from
                            OECD countries. It shows that, while their benefits usually take time to
                            fully materialise, structural reforms seldom involve significant losses
                            and often deliver gains already in the short run. At the same time,
                            though, some of them, such as unemployment benefit and job protection
                            reforms, have smaller or even negative effects in depressed economies.
                            Current conditions of wide remaining spare capacity, constrained
                            macroeconomic policies and impaired fiscal positions in most
                            OECD countries would put a premium on reforms that offer comparatively
                            strong short­term gains in terms of facilitating the jobs

                        shed light on how the impact of structural reform varies across different
                        types of reform as well as over time, identifying the horizon over which
                        their full effects materialise, and investigating how such effects may
                        depend on a country’s economic conditions. These issues are especially
                        important in the current economic context; indeed at a time when spare
                        capacity remains high in many OECD countries and macroeconomic policies are
                        constrained (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P00-c01" format="Chapter" object="chapter" type="sing" cont="no"/>), there is a
                        premium on reforms that would help kick-start the recovery.</p>
          <p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c04-s01-p0008" numbering="n" indent="y">The benefits of structural
                        reforms – typically aimed at increasing labour productivity or employment –
                        often take time to materialise, and their short and long­term impacts may
                        differ. Many long­term gains can involve transition costs, due for instance
                        to the disappearance of firms and associated layoffs in the wake of product
                        market liberalisation, or because it takes time for capital to find new
                        productive uses and for workers to find new jobs when reforms involve
                        reallocation (Blanchard and Giavazzi, 2003). On the other hand, some
                        structural reforms can boost growth quickly; for instance, if they improve
                        confidence and increase expected future income gains, they can immediately
                        stimulate consumption and investment. Likewise, forward­looking financial
                        markets can incorporate healthier longer­term economic prospects – and
                        therefore the effects of reforms – into asset prices, thereby further
                        stimulating near­term activity.</p>

                                with spending increases or revenue reductions that fall mainly on

                                    lower unemployment benefits boost job creation by increasing

                                    three years in the average OECD country. Consistent with their
                                    employment effects, benefit reforms are also found to be

                            Indeed, the short­term positive effects of unemployment benefit and job
                            protection reforms turn out to be stronger during
                                <shortcitation>good</shortcitation> times, and weaker – and in some
                            cases even negative – during <shortcitation>bad</shortcitation> times.
                            For example, the analysis suggests that a

                            unemployment benefit replacement rate would bring about a 0.5 percentage

                            as indicated by a zero unemployment gap – but the same reform could lead

                            the unemployed to look harder for a job might increase outflows from
                            unemployment when the labour market is tight, it could be ineffective
                            and even counter­productive when labour demand is particularly weak.

                            finding is that education and anti­discrimination policies,
                            well­designed labour market institutions and large and/or progressive
                            tax and transfer systems can all reduce income inequality. On this
                            basis, the chapter identifies several policy reforms that could yield a
                            double dividend in terms of boosting GDP per capita and reducing income
                            inequality, and also flags other policy areas where reforms would entail
                            a trade­off between both objectives.</emphasis>

          <p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s01-p0112" numbering="n" indent="y">In many OECD countries,
                        income inequality has increased in past decades. In some countries, top
                        earners have captured a large share of the overall income gains, while for
                        others income has risen only a little. There is growing consensus that
                        assessments of economic performance should not focus solely on overall
                        income growth, but also take into account income distribution. Some
                        see poverty as the relevant concern while others are concerned with income
                        inequality more generally. A key question is whether the type of
                        growth­enhancing policy reforms advocated for each OECD country and the
                        BRIICS in <emphasis emph="italic">Going for Growth</emphasis> might have
                        positive or negative side effects on income inequality. More broadly, in
                        pursuing growth and redistribution strategies simultaneously, policy makers
                        need to be aware of possible complementarities or trade­offs between the two
                        objectives.</p>
          <p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s01-p0113" numbering="n" indent="y">This chapter sheds new
                        light on this issue, following up on recent OECD work (OECD, 2011). It first
                        highlights differences in income inequality across the OECD and the factors
                        driving them, such as cross­country differences in wage and non­wage income
                        inequality, as well as in hours worked and inactivity. The chapter then
                        provides new analysis of the policy and non­policy determinants of overall
                        income inequality, assessing separately the drivers of labour income
                        inequality and the redistributive role of tax and transfer systems. In each
                        case, the analysis identifies <shortcitation>win­win</shortcitation>
                        policies that can both reduce inequality and promote economic growth, and
                        also highlights policies that may entail trade­offs between the two policy
                        goals.</p>
          <p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s01-p0114" numbering="n" indent="y">OECD countries can be
                        divided into five groups according to their patterns of inequality. For
                        example, in five English­speaking countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland,
                        New Zealand and the United Kingdom) and the Netherlands wages are rather
                        dispersed and the share of part­time employment is high, driving inequality
                        in labour earnings above the OECD average. Means­tested public cash
                        transfers and progressive household taxes reduce overall income inequality,
                        but it remains above the OECD average. At the other end of the scale, four
                        Nordic countries and Switzerland all have comparatively low labour income
                        inequality because wage dispersion is narrow and employment rates are high.
                        Cash transfers tend to be universal and are thus less redistributive. Income
                        inequality for this group is considerably below the OECD average.</p>

                        new empirical analysis which shows that although technological change and
                        globalisation have played a role in widening the distribution of labour
                        income, the marked cross­country variation is likely due to differences in
                        policies and institutions. This leads to the following conclusions about
                        policies and institutions:</p>

                                labour market policies and institutions can reduce inequality. A
                                relatively high minimum wage narrows the distribution of labour
                                income, but if set too high it may reduce employment, which dampens
                                its inequality­reducing effect. Institutional arrangements that
                                strengthen trade unions also tend to reduce labour earnings
                                inequality by ensuring a more equal distribution of earnings. Job
                                protection reforms that make permanent and temporary contracts more

                                the OECD is due to transfers. However, the redistributive impact of
                                cash transfers varies widely across countries, reflecting both the

                            widely in the dispersion of earnings among full­time workers, with
                            Chile, the United States and Portugal being the most unequal countries
                            and Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland being the most equal ones (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s02-01-g008" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>). Inequality is
                            higher in all countries when extending the analysis to part­time workers
                            or the entire working age population (<emphasis emph="italic">i.e.</emphasis> also including the unemployed and the inactive),
                            reflecting the large income differentials between these groups and
                            full­time workers. This effect is particularly large for countries where
                            part­time workers make up a sizable share of total employment (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> Australia, Germany, Japan,

                            Italy). Accounting for household size and composition reveals a more
                            complex picture (OECD, 2008a). Working household members often combine
                            their income, which narrows the dispersion of income because of the
                            ensuing economies of scale in consumption, whereas the inclusion of

                                    Greece, Hungary, Korea, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain, while the
                                    share of part­time employment is high in Austria and Japan. In
                                    some of these countries (in particular Greece and Korea), an
                                    important redistribution of labour earnings occurs within
                                    families. Cash transfers tend to have little redistributive
                                    impact since they are small in size (Korea) or largely
                                    insurance­based and thus not highly progressive (Austria,
                                    Germany, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Poland and Spain). Overall,
                                    both the dispersion in household disposable income and the
                                    poverty rate are close to the OECD average.</p>

                            higher­skilled workers more than others. For example, to the extent that
                            medium­skilled workers focus on routine tasks that can also be
                            accomplished by computers, technological change will reduce the demand

                            manual non­routine tasks, both of which are harder to replace by

                            growing body of studies of individual firms, but it is more difficult to
                            establish a robust link at the aggregate level.</p>

                            Policies that foster equity in education lower income inequality by
                            reducing the dispersion of earnings. The same applies to policies that
                            promote upper secondary or tertiary education, at least in countries
                            with an already high share of upper secondary or tertiary graduates,
                            respectively, among the working­age population. For many labour market
                            policies, by contrast, the impact is less clear cut as they affect both
                            the dispersion of earnings and the level of employment in sometimes
                            conflicting ways, at least for some types of workers. Examples include
                            increasing the minimum wage relative to the median wage, increasing the
                            level of employment protection and increasing the generosity of
                            unemployment benefits. One labour market reform that stands out as
                            having a positive effect on both employment and earnings equality is
                            lowering the gap of employment protection on temporary and permanent
                            work. The impact of product market liberalisation on income inequality
                            is ambiguous. While boosting employment, some types of product market
                            reforms may widen the distribution of earnings. A rough quantification

                                    to measure inequality is to look at the ratio between different
                                    income percentiles. The ratio between incomes at the top of the
                                    distribution (the 90th percentile) and at the bottom (the 10th
                                    percentile) is abbreviated as the 90/10 ratio. A fall in the
                                    90/10 ratio means that inequality is falling. The average
                                    90/10 percentile ratio in OECD countries is about 4.5 with a

                            systems play a key role in lowering overall income inequality. Cash
                            transfers – such as pensions, unemployment and child benefits – account
                            for more than three quarters of the overall redistributive impact, and
                            taxes for one quarter. However, there are large differences across the
                            OECD in the size, composition and progressivity of taxes and cash
                            transfers (Joumard<emphasis emph="italic"> et al.</emphasis>, 2012). On
                            the transfer side, pensions account for the bulk of total transfers in
                            most but not all countries (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s03-03-g013" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>). They
                            primarily aim at redistributing income over the lifetime of individuals
                            – those with higher incomes contribute more but will also receive higher
                            pensions. Thus, pensions often redistribute comparatively less across
                            different individuals. Other transfers are usually more progressive,
                            although how much depends on their design, <emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> the relative portion of flat <emphasis emph="italic">versus</emphasis> income­related benefits. In most
                            countries, family and housing benefits are either universal or

                                of capital income, wealth and inheritance has also been reduced in
                                many countries, which has clearly reduced the redistributive impact
                                of tax systems. Indeed, capital income tends to be increasingly
                                concentrated in the upper income brackets, as do wealth and
                                inheritance (Piketty, 2010; Fredriksen, 2012). Property taxes vary
                                widely across countries. They largely consist of recurrent taxes on
                                immovable property. These taxes, however, often absorb a larger
                                share of the income of poorer households because they are often set
                                as a payment for the benefits of local public services (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g.</emphasis> waste collection) which do not
                                increase fully in line with income.<noteref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s03-03-01-n25" format="noteref"/><note id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s03-03-01-n25"><p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s03-03-01-p0197" numbering="n" indent="y">The
                                        regressive nature of recurrent taxes on immovable property

                                        taxes based on real estate values absorb a large share of
                                        their income. In contrast, working­age households tend to
                                        have higher income and lower wealth and property taxes
                                        absorb a lower share of their income.</p></note></p>

                                dispersion by increasing the share of high­wage earners (the
                                composition effect). On the other hand, new research suggests that
                                this effect may be more than offset by a decline in the returns to
                                tertiary education relative to the returns to lower levels of

                                temporary work and unemployment without getting into permanent work.
                                This can have adverse implications for human capital and career
                                progression (OECD, 2004) and, ultimately, income equality and
                                economic growth. New OECD analysis finds that low­income workers on
                                temporary contracts earn less than workers with similar
                                characteristics on permanent contracts (Fournier and Koske, 2012).
                                This is not the case for higher­income workers. Tentative evidence
                                on the size of the effect illustrated in <xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c05-s03-02-t00" format="Table" object="table" type="sing" cont="no"/> suggests,
                                for example, that reducing protection for permanent work from the
                                level observed in Germany (third­highest level) to that observed in
                                Finland (which is about OECD average) while increasing protection
                                for temporary work from the level observed in the United Kingdom
                                (second­lowest level) to that observed in Finland (which is about
                                OECD average) would reduce the 90/10 percentile ratio by about 0.24
                                (which is about 7% of the average 90/10 percentile ratio in
                                OECD countries). More even job protection for temporary and
                                permanent contracts is also likely to reduce the income gap between
                                immigrants and non­immigrants, as previous studies have shown that
                                immigrants suffer disproportionately from contract­related labour

                                participation. Targeted policies, such as language courses, and
                                transparent systems of recognising foreign qualifications should

                                to take on more caring responsibilities than men, meaning they work
                                fewer hours and thus take home less pay. Arguably, their higher
                                labour supply elasticity should lead women to be taxed at a lower
                                rate than men. Since this is not feasible in practice, policies to
                                improve the availability of formal care for children and the elderly
                                can serve as an alternative solution. Such policies should help to
                                reduce gender differences in working hours and – at least to the
                                extent that hourly wages are little affected – pay, and at the same

                                        provide tax avoidance instruments for top­income earners. In
                                        particular, there is little justification for tax breaks for
                                        stock options and carried interest. Raising such taxes would

                                        labour income tax rates.</p>

                                to be a trade­off with the income distribution objective since

                                wages that are set too high can limit the job market opportunities
                                for young and low­skilled workers. Under such circumstances,
                                lowering relative labour costs may boost the employment of these
                                marginal groups in the labour market (Neumark and Wascher, 2007).
                                Greater employment in turn raises GDP per capita and reduces labour
                                income inequality. However, existing studies, including new OECD
                                analysis (Koske <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2012),
                                suggest that a fall in the minimum wage risks widening the
                                dispersion of wages at the bottom of the distribution among those
                                who are already employed, so that the impact on labour income
                                inequality among the working age population is ambiguous. The
                                employment effect of a lower minimum wage is likely to be smaller
                                when the initial level of minimum labour costs is already low, which
                                increases the likelihood that labour income inequality will

                        shocks often cause large and unforeseen income and employment losses. Such
                        losses tend to be unevenly spread across the population, often with the
                        greatest impact on the poor and the most vulnerable in society. This chapter
                        presents new OECD analysis of the types of policies that have helped to
                        protect the most vulnerable from these losses in a wide group of OECD and
                        emerging countries. These policies include pro­competitive product markets,
                        openness to trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), low tax wedges on
                        labour, a strong fiscal situation, generous unemployment benefits, strong
                        unions, minimum wages and job protection. Some of these policies and
                        institutions also benefit growth and jobs, thereby providing obvious avenues
                        for reform. But others may involve trade­offs between short­term protection
                        and other longer­term economic objectives. Finally, the chapter classifies
                        OECD and emerging economies into four broad groups according to whether
                        their institutional arrangements facilitate risk sharing through strong

                        part the greater sensitivity of certain groups to general economic
                        conditions, but they are also likely to depend on policies and institutions.
                        For instance, during the recent financial crisis youth unemployment
                        increased more in countries with higher statutory minimum wages (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s02-g001" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>, Panel B), and more rigorous
                        analysis presented further below confirms that this was more than mere
                        coincidence.</p>

                        has two fundamental dimensions: The first dimension, international
                        collective risk sharing, concerns the possibilities for a <emphasis emph="italic">country as a whole</emphasis> to insure against or to
                        export the impact of macroeconomic shocks. In practice, international
                        risk­sharing devices are limited.<noteref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-n04" format="noteref"/><note id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-n04"><p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-p0029" numbering="n" indent="y">Individuals can
                                also try to protect themselves against shocks internationally, for
                                example by holding their wealth in foreign­currency denominated
                                assets. However, such options are typically not available to the
                                entire population of a country at the same time, so cannot provide a
                                country with full protection.</p></note> As it is impossible for a country to protect all citizens <emphasis emph="italic">fully</emphasis> from macroeconomic shocks, there is a
                        need to spread the residual impact across individuals, and there is no
                        straightforward burden­sharing criterion to do so (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-b00" format="Box" object="box" type="sing" cont="no"/>).<noteref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-n05" format="noteref"/><note id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-n05"><p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-p0030" numbering="n" indent="y">For instance, when
                                the government takes part of the risk it shifts costs on to current

                                bonds.</p></note> The second dimension of risk sharing therefore covers national
                        public and private mechanisms to share risk across individuals and shape the
                        distributive impact of shocks. This chapter focuses on these mechanisms to
                        share risk across individuals within a country. Examples include
                        unemployment benefit systems or private insurance contracts.<noteref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-n06" format="noteref"/><note id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-n06"><p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s03-p0031" numbering="n" indent="y">Another option in

                                individuals dislike risk, limiting their exposure to risk matters
                                for public policy. The importance of fairness in the way risk is
                                shared across individuals has been recently highlighted by the
                                public outcry over the perceived privatisation of benefits and the

                                increases in macroeconomic risk. In this respect, explicit and

                                institutions (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>deposit

                                    (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. ad hoc</emphasis> bank bail­outs).
                                However, risk­sharing institutions are of little social use when the
                                insurance they provide to some (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>to banks whose failure could damage the banking

                                for how best to split large losses in economy­wide national income
                                and wealth are likely to differ across countries. National choices
                                will reflect a number of tradeoffs, especially between equity and
                                economic efficiency, as many public risk­sharing devices do have a
                                cost in the form of lower aggregate GDP.<boxnoteref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-bs01-n01" format="boxnoteref"/>
                                Fairness would suggest that the larger share of the costs should be
                                borne by those who either benefited most from the risk as long as no
                                shock materialised, or by those who increased the likelihood of the
                                risk occurring in the first place (such as large interconnected
                                banks before the 2007 global financial crisis). Mitigating moral
                                hazard risk, this would also be economically efficient. However, the
                                amount of compensation that can be obtained from corporations or
                                individuals is inevitably limited and typically insufficient to
                                cover the costs of a macroeconomic shock. It is therefore also
                                necessary to decide how the remaining risk should be distributed
                                across the population, especially taking into account income. As
                                poorer individuals have less scope for <shortcitation>self
                                    insurance</shortcitation> – using part of their wealth or
                                borrowing capacity – good risk­sharing institutions should reduce
                                income volatility especially for these people. There may also be a
                                case for providing temporary protection to those who have little
                                possibility of adjusting rapidly to the shock, such as single­parent
                                households with young children or the elderly. Social costs are
                                likely to be particularly high in the wake of large and infrequent
                                shocks, so there is a case for stronger social protection in these
                                circumstances. For example, <emphasis emph="italic">ad hoc</emphasis> mechanisms can be useful where risk­sharing
                                institutions are not well developed and where prudent fiscal
                                behaviour prior to the shock means some fiscal action can be taken.
                                During the recent recession, many OECD countries temporarily
                                extended risk­sharing mechanisms – such as short­time working
                                schemes – and the coverage, level and duration of unemployment
                                benefits.</p>

                                the best risk­sharing policies in place, in reality the outcomes may
                                be sub­optimal. Powerful and politically well­represented groups –
                                the financial sector, large voting groups (<emphasis emph="italic">e.g. </emphasis>baby boomers) or labour­market
                                    <shortcitation>insiders</shortcitation>, for example – may avoid
                                bearing an adequate amount of risk. Other groups with high

                                of risk. Powerful groups may influence risk sharing either directly
                                after a shock, or indirectly by shaping the design of the
                                institutions – such as labour, product and financial market
                                regulations – thereby affecting how the costs of macroeconomic

                                by government­sponsored institutions, such as public unemployment

                        risk­sharing mechanisms provided by governments or private insurance
                        markets, risk sharing within households or extended families can play a
                        large role. This is especially so in the emerging economies, where
                        wage­income risk is often taken care of through risk­sharing within the
                        family and to some extent via informal labour markets. More generally,
                        families (or extended families) allow individual members to pool income
                        risk, and can adjust their labour in response to shocks. In particular, the
                        ability of spouses to adjust their labour market participation and working
                        hours – including in developed economies, when helped by strong childcare
                        subsidies – has often offered valuable protection from household income
                        losses (Attanasio <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2005). Younger
                        workers have the safety net of being able to shift between living with their
                        parents and independently (Kaplan, 2010). In some countries, firms provide
                        their workers with considerable protection from transitory downturns in the
                        firm’s performance (Guiso <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2005).
                        Such transitory economic shocks can also be mitigated through short­time
                        working schemes, under which workers forced into shorter hours are partially
                        compensated by employers or public unemployment insurance schemes (OECD,
                        2010).</p>

                        not only affect the distribution of income, but also of wealth, through
                        their impact on asset prices. As (net) wealth losses increase with leverage,
                        more leveraged age groups are likely to suffer more. This implies that the
                        26­35 year-olds would be likely to lose a larger share of their wealth, as
                        the available data show them to be the most leveraged age group with
                        leverage decreasing gradually after the age of 35. Beyond leverage,
                        portfolio composition also plays a role. Financial crises, for example, are
                        often associated with large falls in house prices and comparatively less
                        severe and shorter­lasting equity price declines.<noteref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-n10" format="noteref"/><note id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-n10"><p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-p0077" numbering="n" indent="y">Reinhart and

                                averaged around 38% for 13 financial crises over the last 30 years.
                                In contrast, equity price declines have been substantially more
                                modest and short lived, with a complete recovery generally reached
                                after three years.</p></note> Consequently, wealth effects from financial crises are larger for
                        those whose asset portfolios primarily consist of housing. These tend to be
                        households with low capital income, since the portfolios of those with
                        sizeable capital income mostly consist of business assets and stocks (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-g003" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>).<noteref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-n11" format="noteref"/><note id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-n11"><p id="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-p0078" numbering="n" indent="y">Households with

                        financial crises. However, with capital income representing a much higher
                        share of their total income, even a comparatively smaller impact on their
                        wealth could translate into a larger impact on their income.</p>

                                    unemployment benefits during the recent crisis helped to cushion
                                    the poor. At the same time, higher levels and a longer duration
                                    of unemployment benefits seem to amplify employment losses for
                                    young and older workers. Previous OECD evidence also points to
                                    adverse effects on unemployment over the longer term, unless
                                    there are effective activation strategies that assist and oblige
                                    the unemployed to return to work (Bassanini and Duval, 2006).
                                    This implies that crisis­related increases in the level or
                                    duration of unemployment benefits should only be temporary where
                                    they were already high before the crisis. By contrast,
                                    unemployment benefit coverage could be permanently extended to
                                    groups that were previously uninsured. If accompanied by
                                    effective activation mechanisms, this wider coverage would
                                    strengthen the effectiveness of social protection systems
                                    without undermining labour market performance.</p>

                                    following adverse shocks. Therefore, lowering high tax wedges on
                                    labour income could not only permanently raise employment
                                    (Bassanini and Duval, 2006) but also mitigate the job losses
                                    incurred by young and older workers in bad times. In such

                                    has long been found to benefit long­term growth, but new
                                    analysis shows that it also increases the negative impact of
                                    financial crises on youth employment, and more generally that it
                                    amplifies the inequitable effects of various shocks (Ahrend
                                        <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 2011b). This
                                    arises mainly as financial market sophistication allows for
                                    increased leverage, thereby amplifying credit cycles and the
                                    depth of financial crises. Similarly, exchange rate devaluations
                                    are found to have disproportionally harmed the poor where the
                                    financial sector (and specifically credit) was more developed
                                        (<xref refid="o12-2012-03-1-P01-c06-s04-01-g007" format="Figure" object="figure" type="sing" cont="no"/>). One explanation could be that financial
                                    development facilitates credit and overinvestment in
                                    non­tradables such as housing during periods of exchange­rate
                                    overvaluation. The larger economic adjustment required in the
                                    wake of the devaluation especially hurts the poor. These risks
                                    further strengthen the case for strong macro and

                        working­age population may strengthen political support for risk­sharing
                        devices that benefit <emphasis emph="italic">both</emphasis> outsiders and
                        insiders, such as higher public spending on active labour market policies
                        (Elmeskov <emphasis emph="italic">et al.</emphasis>, 1998). More broadly,
                        each of the existing <shortcitation>models</shortcitation> may have some
                        degree of internal coherence, making it difficult – and in some cases even
                        unwarranted – to change certain specific policy settings in isolation. Each
                        model may also reflect strong social preferences and different stages of
                        development – looking at best practice within each grouping may be more
                        sensible than all countries aspiring to the same model.</p>
